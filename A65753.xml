            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O man (I conceive) will wonder (Right Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and Dearely Beloved in the Lord) that I preſent you with this ſmall Treatiſe: being an accompt of ſome of my labours which I have taken amongſt you. I know not of whom they are likely to finde (nor deſire they may have) better acceptance then of thoſe, of whoſe love manifeſted unto me in ſo many honours and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, by which you have ſo many waies engaged me now neere theſe two and fourty yeares, (wherein I
<pb facs="tcp:108952:3"/>have continued amongſt you) I have had ſo aboundant and full experience.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, in preſenting you with this poore Treatiſe, I give you of your own (as I may truely ſay with the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14. although not altogether in his ſenſe.) For am not I yours? as S. <hi>Paul</hi> tels the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that himſelfe, and <hi>Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> were theirs: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. And by conſequent the iſſues of all my weake abilities, you may as juſtly challenge to be your own as the Maſter might claime the iſſues of the bondſlaves borne in his houſe, to be his: and as in true eſtimation it is ſuch, ſo I deſire you to accept it, as an acknowledgement (although in no proportion a ſatisfaction) of that great Debt which I owe unto you.</p>
                  <p>And, to ſpeake truth, it will be of ſpeciall uſe to you, to accompt this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of mine, ſuch as it is, as your own,
<pb facs="tcp:108952:3"/>that you may ſo entertaine and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, ſo uſe, husband, and employ it to your beſt advantage, as we uſe to doe thoſe things that are our own. For the chiefe reaſon wherefore the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold helps, which God is pleaſed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us by the labours of other men, uſually profit us ſo little, is, becauſe men looke not on them as matters, wherein themſelves have a peculiar intereſt, and ſo neglect them, as we too uſually doe thoſe things which are of common and generall concernement.</p>
                  <p>As for the matter handled in this ſhort Treatiſe, I deſire you to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that of all the Truths that I have delivered unto you, in ſo large a time of my Miniſtery, continued amongſt you, I have choſen this, above all other ſubjects, to recommend unto you in a more eſpeciall manner, and to leave with you as a memoriall of my tender
<pb facs="tcp:108952:4"/>affection towards you, for theſe two weighty reaſons. Firſt, becauſe this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſtudying the Scriptures (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto this Treatiſe is intended as an help) is of all others of moſt generall concernement, and of moſt neceſſary and common uſe. Secondly, becauſe it hath pleaſed the Lord to caſt us into dangerous times, wherein ſome men endeavour, what they can, to bring the Scriptures into contempt, crying down that ſacred booke, as containing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a dead letter, and being a beggerly element, fit for none but the loweſt forme of Chriſtians. Others, that are unſtable and unlearned, (as the Apoſtle tearmes them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.) wreſt them at their pleaſure, to their own deſtruction, and the endangering of their brethrens ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Let me, therefore, in the bowels of Chriſt, beſeech you (Brethren) as you
<pb facs="tcp:108952:4"/>ever hope to get any power of grace into your hearts, to have your ſpiritual life quickened, your comforts aſſured, and your wayes directed, to take heed to this Sure and Infallible word of Truth, as to a Light ſhining in a darke place, (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.) as containing in it your Food, your Phyſick, your Evidences, your Comforts, your Armes, both for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and defence; and in a word, which is the very life of your Soules, the Light of your Vnderſtanding, the Director of your Wills, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator of your Affections.</p>
                  <p>Study this Word, which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our tearmes Searching of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. which is done not by Reading them over curſorily, but by examining them diligently; comparing Scripture with Scripture, that we may know the full minde of God revealed
<pb facs="tcp:108952:5"/>therein, who many times layes not down the whole truth together in one place, but leaves us to take in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clauſes, out of other places, to make up the full of that truth which hee would reveale unto us. For want of this care of laying Scripture to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, many taking up the truth of God by parts, ground thereupon dangerous errours, wronging God in making him to ſpeake what he never meant, and overthrowing their own Faith, to the hazard of their owne Soules.</p>
                  <p>Of one thing we muſt be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that we bring with us our minds free, and not prepoſſeſt with any Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which we have either framed in our owne phantaſy, or received from others: A mind foreſtalled by an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous conceipt, is no fit Judge of any Truth, or of any Teſtimony co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Truth; but as coloured glaſſe tranſmits
<pb facs="tcp:108952:5"/>the light, and repreſents it to the eye infected with the ſame colour with which it ſelfe is dyed: Or as the taſte, diſtempered by ſome ill humour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth all things which it receives according to that humour with which it ſelfe is infected: ſo happens it with a minde prepoſſeſt with any phantaſie, it apprehends and judgeth of all things according to that opinion which it ſelfe hath entertained.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the Scriptures being in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves exceeding broad (to uſe the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts expreſsion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.96.) that is, of large comprehenſion, and withall very myſterious, containing in them wonders, (as they are tearmed, <hi>ver.</hi> 18.) there needs, together with our reading, much Meditation upon what we have read, (as the ſame Prophet tells us, that he did meditate upon Gods Law all the day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97.) much confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb facs="tcp:108952:6"/>eſpecially with Miniſters, and other experienced Chriſtians, much uſe of learned mens writings, which give great light to the underſtanding of darke places in Scripture, which wee ſhall often meet withall: But above all, fervent and continuall Prayers, wherein acknowledging our owne blindneſſe, and inability, of our ſelves, to ſearch into the deep Myſteries revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Word, (with <hi>Agur, Prov.</hi> 30.2, 3.) we beg earneſtly the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, to open our eyes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.18. to make us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the way of his precepts, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. to give us underſtanding that wee may know his teſtimonies, <hi>ver.</hi> 125. being aſſured, that as there is no other meanes to reveale unto us the mind of God, but his Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. ſo God will not deny that help to thoſe that ask it, <hi>Iames</hi> 1.5. as his children finde
<pb facs="tcp:108952:6"/>by their owne experience, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.27.</p>
                  <p>The publiſhing of this Treatiſe is, by the Providence of God, caſt into the laſt of my daies, perhaps, that you might lay neerer to your hearts, and more heedfully remember the laſt words and counſels of your dying Paſtor, as uſually the laſt directions and adviſe of dying Parents, or other neer friends, make a ſtrong impreſſion upon the hearts of thoſe to whom they are given: Withall ſeeing, being ſhortly to be taken from you, I ſhall be able to doe you no more ſervice, in mine owne perſon, I deſire to leave this monument behind me, that when I ſhall be ſeen no more, being dead I may yet ſpeake unto you, as <hi>Abel</hi> is ſaid to doe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4.</p>
                  <p>And now (Brethren) I know you cannot but be very ſenſible of that ſad condition, into which you were lately
<pb facs="tcp:108952:7"/>reduced, when not onely you ſuffered the ſpoiling of your goods, but your very lives did hang in doubt before you, and you feared day and night, having no aſſurance of your lives, as the Lord threatens it ſhould happen to his people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.66. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that the memory of thoſe ſad times may be ſtill freſh in your minds, that your fleſh may ſtill tremble for the feare of God, and you may be afraid of his Judgements (to uſe the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts phraſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.120.) that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving for what evills the wrath of God was then kindled againſt you, you may the more carefully watch over your waies, for time to come, that you provoke not the Lord hereafter to powre out his indignation in ſome more fearefull judgement, whoſe hand you have found ſo heavy upon you in what you have felt already.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:108952:7"/>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, I beſeech you withall, take notice of a mixture of many mercies, even with that heavy Judgement. As, firſt, that God gave you yet your lives for a prey, which is all the favour that he promiſed <hi>Baruch, Ier.</hi> 45.5. and that not onely by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving you from the enemies ſword, but beſides by withdrawing his owne hand when the laſt yeare he called to contend by the Peſtilence, which brake in upon you ſeverall times and by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall waies, and yet gleaned onely a few amongſt you, here and there, at that time, when ſome other Townes were almoſt layed waſt by the ſame ſtroake of Gods hand, but the Lord ſtill repented him for this, and ſaid, it ſhall not be, <hi>Amos</hi> 7.3, 6.</p>
                  <p>Againe, though your eſtates were waſted, yet your dwellings were preſerved, that you might not bee
<pb facs="tcp:108952:8"/>as <hi>Sodome,</hi> or like unto <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> as ſome other places are: as it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten threatned, and as often really inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by your enemies, and had queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onles been accordingly executed, had not the Lord by his Power and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence almoſt miraculouſly prevented it, ſaying unto them as he doth unto the ſea, <hi>Job</hi> 38.11. Hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no farther, and here ſhall thy proud waves be ſtayed: as if God had reaſoned with himſelfe as he doth concerning his owne people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8, 9.

                  <p>Above all the reſt of Gods favours, mixed with thoſe judgements w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you lately felt; eſteeme not this as the leaſt, that although your Teachers have been driven into corners, yet they have been by Gods goodneſſe preſerved for your farther ſervice, and are now reſtored to you in ſafety, that your eyes behold them, and your eares heare their voice, ſhewing you the way that you ſhould walke in, when you turne aſide to the right or left hand; a mercy which God accompts ſufficient to ſweeten even the bread of adverſity and the water of affliction, <hi>Iſay</hi> 30.20. And even that want of them for a while, may be of ſpeciall uſe to you, to warne you to ſet an higher price on Gods Ordinances hereafter, and to anſwer them with proportionable fruits, leſt God bring upon you that heavy judgement, threatned againſt his owne people, the
<pb facs="tcp:108952:9"/>utter taking away of his Kingdome from them, to beſtow it on a people, that might yeeld him a better accompt thereof, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43.</p>
                  <p>As for the loſſes which you have ſuſtained in your outward Eſtates (which conſidering how long you were in the enemies hand, were leſſe then moſt other Townes have felt) if you ſuffer any hurt thereby, you have none to blame but your ſelves. If God by your owne experience ſhew you the vanity of theſe outward things, which we cannot hold when we have them, that availe not in the day of wrath, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.4. that comfort us leaſt when we need it moſt, that too often prove ſnares unto us, while we enjoy them, and leave us nothing but ſorrowes when we loſe them, and thereby take off your hearts from lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and depending on them, that yee
<pb facs="tcp:108952:9"/>may take care to lay up your Treaſures in Heaven (as our Saviour adviſeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.20.) out of the reach of thieves and plunderers, (which we may truely conceive to be the end that God aimed at in delivering you into the hands of ſpoylers and robbers) you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come great gainers by all your loſſes.</p>
                  <p>I know what carnall reaſon will ſuggeſt, that it ſtands you upon to bee now more earneſt in labouring with all diligence to repaire your loſſes; and it grieves my heart to ſee, that this counſel prevailes ſo much with many, that ſhould by this time have learned Chriſt better. Give me leave to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you a praecedent of your owne. About 34. yeares ſince, the Lord ſent upon this towne a fearefull fire, which conſumed the beſt part of it, the loſſe at an under value amounting to more then fourty thouſand pounds. What
<pb facs="tcp:108952:10"/>fell out thereupon? There met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about ſeven or eight well-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted perſons, and agreed to contribute in money, and annuities, out of their Lands, the ſumme of eight hundred pounds for the erecting of an Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, for the ſetting of poore children on worke: The whole towne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to double their weekely rates for reliefe of the poore, enlarged their Churches, and reduced the towne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to order by good governement: What gained they by all this? within the compaſſe of ſix or ſeaven yeares, God ſo poured out his bleſſings upon the place, that it was in that ſhort ſpace in better condition then it had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that calamity fell upon them. Can you have a better argument then that, which is taken from experience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your ſelves? Or is there to bee found a ſurer or more comfortable
<pb facs="tcp:108952:10"/>way of making up your loſſes, then that which you found ſo ſucceſſefull then? Follow their ſteps, honour God with the firſt of your ſubſtance, which he hath left you, relieve his poore ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſet effectually upon the reducing of the towne to order by Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God is ſtill the ſame God, and will not faile to ſupply you with ſuch eſtates as will be beſt and meeteſt for you.</p>
                  <p>I aſſure my ſelfe you want neither will, nor reſolution to ſet forward the workes, wherein Gods honour and the welfare of this place are ſo much concerned: Onely I deſire you to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the firſt opportunities, which the Lord ſhall put into your hand, to bring your purpoſes to effect.

                  <p>NOtwithſtanding yours, or the Printers haſte and importunity, I muſt not let theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of ſo much worth goe out of my hands without that due teſtimony which my heart gives of them. As the compilement of them is cloſe, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; ſo, the materials full of <hi>ſpirituall vigor,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a ſtrength both of <hi>Harmonious,</hi> and alſo <hi>Argumentative</hi> Reaſon. The ſubjects themſelves all ſeaſonable, when enjoyments of God through <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Revelation,</hi> without us, and by <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall experience withinus, is eſteemed but a living upon the letter, &amp; a way beneath for infant Chriſtians to walke with God in. And both theſe you have here with much evidence vindicated and cleared. As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Morality of the fourth Commandement</hi> (the conſcientious obſervation of which hath (through the bleſsing of God following his own inſtitutions) both elevated and preſerved at its height, the practicall part of the power of godlineſſe in this Kingdome,) which is laid aſide by many true profeſſors of piety, as a part of the Iewiſh paedagogie.</p>
                  <p>For the particulars themſelves, your <hi>Deſcription of a ſpirituall man;</hi> is deeply fetcht from that which conſtitutes him ſuch, and doth genuinely diſtinguiſh him from all other, by that which is moſt proper to his conſtitution, and peculiar to his Faith, namely, <hi>The Demonſtration of the Spirit.</hi> And as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb facs="tcp:108952:12"/>is ſpirituall, ſuch are your characters given, and your way of reading it; exceeding ſpirituall: even according to the Apoſtles owne direction: comparing (or ſuiting) ſpirituall things with ſpirituall; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly is alſo full of that demonſtration of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which you therein make eſſentiall and conſtitutive of his faith. I ſee how ever we may differ in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks, and matters of outward order a little; yet in ſpiritualls, or what is more conjunct to the inward and ſpiritual man, we agree. All our lives meet not in that part of the circumference, yet in this center we unite and embrace; and herein I doe rejoyce, and will rejoyce for ever.</p>
                  <p>In your firſt &amp; main part, concerning the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> your diſcourſe beares a comely ſuitableneſſe to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſcope of that ſubject alſo. For as the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall beleefe of their authority, end, and uſe, is the foundation of all: ſo your demonſtrations thereof are formed out of, and framed into a congeniall Harmony and conſonancy to right Reaſon, and containe a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Genealogy and ſtory of divine Truth about them, whereof one is the off-ſpring of the other: which way of ſetting forth divine Truths, as it carries with it the greateſt conviction, and (as your ſelfe (in that foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Treatiſe) expreſſe it) begets Faith Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall, which hath for its ground a rationality, and conſonancy to reaſon; ſo it is made uſe of by the holy Ghoſt, as a bleſſed ſubſervient to that which you make the immediate proper cauſe of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith, <hi>The Demonſtration of the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For your laſt peece, The more generall notion of ſuch an indefinite ſenſe of the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
<pb facs="tcp:108952:12"/>I remember you and I long ſince mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually pleaſed our ſelves to have ſingly and apart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in. But this your ſo exact particular explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and demonſtration of this intent of God therein, exceedes what I either did then, or have ſince ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, could have with that rationality, perſpicuity, even to more then a probability, been made forth of the words thereof. I doe herein exceedingly admire the wiſdome of God in penning and ordering the words of that Fourth Commandement in ſuch a poſture (whereof you have made obſervation) as that command might become a genuine and naturall root, (more naturall then <hi>Abraham</hi> is to Jew and Gentiles ſucceſſively;) Firſt, to beare that laſt ſeventh day, that old Sabbath the Omega of the weeke, and when that ſhould be lopt off, then to give as freſh ſap to the firſt ſeventh day, the Alpha of the week, the Lords day Sabbath. It makes me ſay of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, with an inverſion, what the Apoſtle ſayes upon the like reaſon, of that of Love, It was an old Commandement, and yet is ſtill a new one.</p>
                  <p>Sir, as the honour you have done me to commit theſe Treatiſes to the Teſt of my weake judgement ere you tranſmitted them to the preſſe, hath cleane taken off that little of jealouſy of any ſtrangeneſſe by reaſon of theſe unhappy differences in compariſon of former intimacy: ſo the quickning materials hereof have fully revived in my heart that intenſeneſſe of Chriſtian and Brotherly love towards you, with this juſt cauſe of addition and encreaſe: That after your having ſacrificed your ſpirits and ſtrength in the moſt publique way of ſervice to God and his

To manifeſt the neceſſity of due preparation in reading the Scriptures, much more might be ſpoken, and many more ill conſequents might be obſerved, that are occaſioned by the neglect thereof: But the conſiderations already mentioned, are ſufficient to evince the uſefulneſſe and neceſſity of ſuch a preparation. Taking that therefore for granted, that this duty of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when we undertake the reading of holy Scriptures, muſt be performed, our next work muſt be to give directions for the manner, and order how the Readers heart muſt be fitted to the performance of this task, which cannot well be done without taking knowledge of the nature of that word which is to be read, and of the end and ſcope at which it aims.</p>
                     <p>That the obſervation of the nature of Gods word which we read,
<note place="margin">2 Directed by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, 1. the nature of the Scriptures.</note> may much farther us in this duty of preparation to the reading, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Scriptures, is evident by our uſe and cuſtome in ordinary things of this life. We chuſe and husband our grounds according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſeed wherewith we intend to ſow it; and according to the nature and condition of that matter wherewith we fill our Veſſels, wee make choice of them, appointing ſome for dry things, and others for moiſt, and fit them diverſly for foul or clean. In like manner muſt we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nature of the Word, if we mean to order our hearts aright, which are the grounds that muſt receive this holy ſeed, the Veſſels that muſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108952:16"/>contain this precious balm. We muſt therefore conſider that the word is a pure word, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 119.140. that we may cleanſe and purifie our hearts for the receiving of it. We muſt know that the Law is ſpirituall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>James</hi> 3.17. that we may labour for ſpirituall and heavenly mindes to entertain it; we muſt apprehend it as a word of power and authority, the voice of God, that mighty Creator of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, before our hearts can be ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive and entertain it with that meeknes, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.21. and trembling of heart, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. which is required. We muſt be perſwaded that it is a ſure word, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. a faithfull word, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9. a viſion that will not lye, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. as proceeding out of the mouth of him that cannot lye, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. or elſe we ſhall never be prepared to embrace it with faithfull and beleeving hearts, without which the word cannot profit us at all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2.</p>
                     <p>In the next place,
<note place="margin">2 By obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the end wherat the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures aim.</note> we muſt take knowledge of the end wherefore the word was given, if we mean to uſe and apply it as we ought: ſeeing we know one cannot uſe an inſtrument aright, unleſſe he know for what uſe it was made. Now the principall ends for which the Scriptures were given, were; Firſt, the manifeſting of God unto us,
<note place="margin">1. Making God known to us. 2. Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ways.</note> that we may honour him as God. Secondly, the directing of us in the courſe of our converſation, not onely by informing our judgements, but by obliging our conſciences, to guide our ſelves by the rules propoſed therein, in the courſe of our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108952:17"/>practiſe. Wherefore the Prophet <hi>David</hi> uſed Gods Law as a lanthorn to his feet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105. thinking on his ways, that he might turn his feet to Gods teſtimonies, <hi>v.</hi> 59. remembring that the things which are revealed,
<note place="margin">3. Yea converting the ſoul.</note> belong to us to do them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. So that as the power of the Scriptures is to purifie the ſoul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. and convert it, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.7. ſo the uſe of it beſides is, to make the man of God perfect unto every good work, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17. that ſo it may prove the power of God every way, both to ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſalvation, as the Apoſtle affirms it to be, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 1.16. Without the knowledg of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſcope whereat the word aims, it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible either to obſerve what we ought in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Scriptures, or to apply them aright.</p>
                     <p>That we may therefore give fit directions for the profitable reading of the Scriptures, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appears to be neceſſary to enquire, firſt, both into their nature, and ſcope: And as for their nature, it cannot well be opened, unleſſe we conſider the Author by whom the Scriptures were given, (from whom withall flows their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) the inſtruments by which they were conveighed to the Church, and the matter or ſubject which they handle: wherewith if we take in the ſcope at which they aim, their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary uſe unto us, their power to command us, and ability to work effectually in us; and laſtly, their infallible and undoubted truth and righteouſneſſe will evidently appear. So that we ſhall have juſt occaſion to handle in order theſe four points:</p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:108952:17"/>
                     <p n="1">1. The Author from whom ariſeth the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Penmen by whom they were written.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The matter or ſubject which they handle.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The ſcope or end at which they aim.</p>

                        <p>IT muſt be conſidered that at preſent, we have nothing to doe with Atheiſts, Pagans, Jews, or Turks, that deny the Scriptures, either wholly, or in part, ſo far are they from acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them to be Gods word; but onely with ſuch perſons, as admitting and allowing them to be the word of God, doe yet want ſome clearer light, and fuller evidence, to work into their hearts a more certain perſwaſion, and more feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impreſſion of that truth whereof they are convinced, that all that is within them, even their whole heart, may not onely bow and ſtoop, but be wholly thrown down, and laid flat on the earth before this mighty ſcepter of the kingdom of Chriſt. Wherefore, we ſhall not need to bring in all the arguments that are uſed and taken up by others, to prove the Scriptures to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108952:18"/>be Gods word, but paſſing by amongſt them ſuch as are more obſcure and farther deduced, ſhall content our ſelves with ſuch plain eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this truth, as may be beſt underſtood of the ſimple, and appear at the firſt view, as being lively characters imprinted on the face and body of this ſacred Book, by that divine Spirit that compoſed it.</p>
                        <p>Before we lay open theſe evidences it will be needfull to demonſtrate, that it is neither poſſible, nor fit, that theſe Scriptures ſhould flow from any other fountain, then the moſt ſacred breaſt of that holy Lord, who is the onely fountain of all wiſdome and truth, and the God of all ſoveraignty and power. A truth which will be eaſily acknowledged, if in the firſt place we take notice, that it is generally confeſſed that the Scriptures are, or at leaſt contain that Law which is left unto the Church of God, for the right ordering thereof in all things, which alſo is evident to all that read them; And yet that this truth may be more fully cleared, it will not be amiſſe to eſtabliſh theſe two Poſitions.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That the Church of God muſt have a Law.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That this Law can be found in no other books but the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>That Gods Church muſt have a Law,
<note place="margin">That Gods Church muſt have a Law; proved, 1<hi rend="sup">t</hi> By the light of Nature, directing all ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern by Laws.</note> and that as it is a Church, I conceive no ſober man will deny, if it were not proved, being ſo clearly manifeſted by the conſtant practiſe of all Nations and ſocieties of men from the beginning of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108952:18"/>the world, as having found the eſtabliſhing of laws the onely means of preſerving themſelves from ruine. The truth is, there was never found any Nation ſo barbarous, that was not gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſome kinde of Law or other. If then the light of Nature directed all men generally to the uſe of laws, as the main band of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety, and the beſt remedy againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and ruine that neceſſarily attends upon it; ſhall we think that the God of nature, the fountain of all wiſdome, the firſt, and beſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of ſocieties would leave the body of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety compoſed by himſelf, as it were the work of his own hand, in more hazard then men do the ſtates which they ſettle and ſtabliſh by their counſell?</p>
                        <p>Again,
<note place="margin">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Becauſe the Church, of all ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, moſt needs a law, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1 Both the largeſt &amp; moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed of all ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> we know that the larger the body of a State is, and the more diſperſed, the more need it hath to be firmly knit together by thoſe ſtrong bands of ſociety: Now we ſee the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ſocieties that are amongſt men, and the moſt neerly compacted together, the inhabitants of one ſmall City, the fellows of one Colledge, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by laws and orders: whereas the Church is the largeſt of all ſocieties in the world in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and moſt diſperſed, as being poſſible to be ſcattered over the whole face of the earth, and conſequently above all other ſtates on earth needs to be eſtabliſhed by the beſt laws, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardeſt to be governed, and moſt ſubject to diſorder and confuſion without them.</p>
                        <p>In the next place, we ſee the laws of men
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108952:19"/>reach no farther then the ordering of mens out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward converſation,
<note place="margin">2 To be ordered in the very motions of the heart;</note> and meddle not with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoughts and motions of the minde. But in the government of the Church, the chiefeſt work muſt be the ruling of the heart and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as the Apoſtle tels us, that Gods word and laws reach to the imaginations of the heart, and bring under the very thoughts to the obedience of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. and enter into the very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of the ſoul and ſpirit, and to the diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the thoughts of the heart,
<note place="margin">Which are, 1 More va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then outward actions. 2 More ſpeedily moved &amp; hardly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</note> 
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. Now how much greater variety and diverſity there is in mens thoughts, then in their actions, how much more eaſily and ſpeedily they are moved, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently with how much greater difficulty they are governed and kept in order, is evident to all men. Conſequently we muſt conceive, that the juſt, wiſe, and provident God that directed all men to give laws to order mens actions, would himſelf much more give laws for the ordering and well governing of the thoughts and conſcience.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> And the Church being Gods more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care, as being, 1 His own inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> if God in the courſe of his Providence have taken order, that other ſtates, to which he hath onely a generall relation, as Lord of all the earth, ſhould be governed and ordered by fit laws for the preſervation of ſociety and peace: we cannot deny, but his care muſt be much greater for the governing and well ordering of his own people, in whom he delights, his choſen generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his peculiar inheritance, which he hath ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to bring forth fruits to himſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. in whoſe good or ill carriage (ſeeing his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108952:19"/>Name is called upon them) his honour is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed,
<note place="margin">2 In which his own honour is moſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſed.</note> then any parents can be in the behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of his own children. And conſequently we muſt conclude, that if all the States in the world were left without government, yet God would give laws, nay, the moſt exact and perfect laws, for the well ordering of his own Church, ſeeing it redounds ſo much to his own honour, as <hi>Moſes</hi> tels us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.7, 8.</p>
                        <p>Thus then the firſt Poſition propoſed is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough,
<note place="margin">This law can be found no where but in the Scriptures.</note> that the Church of God muſt have a law. The next is more clear then it, that this law can bee found in no other books then the Scriptures. And, to prove it, we need no more but to put men to produce us any other volume beſides this ſacred book, wherein that law is written, let them name us to whoſe cuſtody it was committed, and where it may be found. There is no reaſon the law given to the Church ſhould bee committed to any other then the Churches keeping;
<note place="margin">1 Becauſe the Church, the keeper of its own records acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth no other. 2 Other baſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writings compared with it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.</note> now the Church acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no other Book for the word or law of God, but this alone; neither did ever any dare to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that any other book beſides this, was Gods word or law; if any ſhould, the very comparing of ſuch baſtard-writings, with the true word, would eaſily diſcover them to be no better then coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.</p>
                        <p>But to clear this point more fully, we ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to manifeſt this one truth more, which any ſober minded man will eaſily aſſent unto, namely, that it is neither poſſible, nor in any ſort conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108952:20"/>that the law for the governing of the Church ſhould be given by any other then by God himſelf.
<note place="margin">Beſides, 1<hi rend="sup">t</hi> It was not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other then God himſelfe ſhould give this law. 1 Becauſe it rules the ſpirit of man, to which no creature can give a law: As being unable to take ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the breach thereof. 2 Becauſe Gods will muſt be the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches law,</note> Firſt then, it is not poſſible, and that upon a double ground. The firſt is, that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Spirit, and therefore to be worſhipped and ſerved in ſpirit and truth, <hi>John</hi> 4.24. the laws that preſcribe the duties of that worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, muſt of neceſſity reach to the ſpirit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man. Now the giving of ſuch laws is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond mans power, and therefore no law-giver, from the beginning of the world, ever took upon him that task. And indeed, it were abſurd for a man to give ſuch lawes, of the obſervation or breach whereof he could take no account: now we know, ſeeing no man can know the thoughts of another mans heart, it is impoſſible for him to judge whether they be anſwerable or contrary to the law, by which they were appointed to be ordered.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond reaſon, why it is impoſſible for any other then God himſelf, to give a law unto the Church is, becauſe it is agreeable to all rules of equity, that Gods own will ſhould be the law and rule to all creatures, ſeeing they are all the work of his hand, much more to the Church, which beſides her Creation,
<note place="margin">Being his own both by Creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> he hath purchaſed to himſelf by the blood of his Son, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently being his own, by the ſtrongeſt title, muſt be diſpoſed according to his will, even by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours rule, which allows one to doe with his own what he will, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.15. If then Gods will muſt be the creatures law, who can give it but himſelf?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108952:20"/>for who hath known the minde of the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.34? Surely, if none known the things of man, but the ſpirit which is in man,
<note place="margin">Now none can know Gods minde but himſelf.</note> the minde of God can much leſſe be known by any but his own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. It is true concerning a mans mind, ſeeing it is moved according to reaſon, in order to the end which he propoſeth to himſelf, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one that knows another mans end, may with ſome probability gueſſe at his thoughts, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes tending to that end, which <hi>Solomon</hi> implies in affirming, that though counſell be hidden deep in the heart of man, yet a man of underſtanding may draw it out, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.5. And ſo a man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Gods main end, in all his ways, is his own honour, may conclude that Gods law muſt be ſuch as may direct men in thoſe ways, in which they may moſt glorifie God. But what thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular directions muſt be, it is impoſſible for men to gueſſe, till God himſelf reveal them.</p>
                        <p>It is true, that the very light of nature, which God hath planted in every man, will diſcover unto him ſome of the chief heads of the duties, that he requires of him, as to love the Lord with all our hearts, and to fear, and ſerve him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12. And to ſerve one another through love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13. But in what particular ſervices we are to expreſſe our piety to God, or love to men, what man can preſcribe or imagine? For that the ways by which both theſe main duties may be performed, are various and divers, it is evident, now to which of theſe different ways God would direct one, it was impoſſible to gueſſe, till God himſelf had
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108952:21"/>made it manifeſt in his own word.</p>
                        <p>To give inſtance of this truth in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
<note place="margin">Eſpecially laws poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive muſt needs bee given by God alone</note> it was impoſſible for any man to conceive what ceremonies or outward acts God would accept and be beſt pleaſed withall in the duties of his worſhip. No man could divine that the tree of life ſhould be a Sacrament to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe: or Circumciſion to the Jews, or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and the Lords Supper to Chriſtians. For ought any man could conceive to the contrary, the Prieſthood might have been ſetled upon the Tribe of <hi>Simeon,</hi> as well as <hi>Levi.</hi> The reſt of the Sabbath might have been fixed on the ſecond or ſixth day, as well as on the ſeventh, and on the firſt, if God had ſo appointed it. And for the duties of the ſecond Table, it was not of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity that God ſhould eſtabliſh ſuch a kinde of ſubordination and ſubjection of one man to another, as he hath done, or give every man a propriety in his goods, to poſſeſſe them as ſeverall to himſelf, or limit one man to one wife, and ordain marriage for the onely way of propagation of mankinde: ſeeing that, although all theſe are fit and convenient, yet God (if hee had pleaſed) might have given other rules for the governing and eſtabliſhing peace amongſt men, and it was as lawfull for him to give the creatures what laws he pleaſed, as to give them what natures he pleaſed. So that ſeeing the law for the right ordering of the creatures depends meerly upon Gods will, which cannot be known, unleſſe himſelf reveal it, it muſt needs be granted,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108952:21"/>which was firſt propoſed, that none could give the law to Gods Church but God himſelf.</p>
                        <p>Next, if it had been poſſible,
<note place="margin">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Nor is it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that any other then God ſhould give this law. 1 For pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Gods au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</note> it was no way fit, either for the advancing of Gods honour, or for the furthering of mans good, that any other ſhould give that law then God himſelf. Not fit for Gods honour in two reſpects; Firſt, Gods authority could be no way ſo well preſerved, as by giving his own law to his people; ſeeing all men acknowledge that giving of laws is an honour annexed to the higheſt power, although the execution of them be committed to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of a lower degree. It may be probably gueſſed, that even heathen Law-givers, by preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, either conſulting with their gods in giving their laws, or allowance of them by them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged law-making to be a divine prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; which yet is more fully manifeſted by this, that we acknowledge no law to bee juſt that is not either founded on, or conſonant to Gods law, either written in mans heart, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in his word. So that it was fit that God ſhould give the law to his own people, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his own authority amongſt them.</p>
                        <p>Again, it is requiſite for Gods honour in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect,
<note place="margin">2 And that we might have a perfect mirrour of him. Which none could give but himſelf.</note> that none but God himſelf ſhould give his own law to his people, becauſe none is able to give ſo perfect a mirrour of God, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. As for men, we know none of them hath ſeen God at any time, <hi>John</hi> 1.17. and it is ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a portion that they know of him, <hi>Job</hi> 26.14. that it is impoſſible they ſhould ſet him out as he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108952:22"/>deſerves. Now it is for Gods honour that hee ſhould be expreſſed as fully as may be, which neither is, nor can be performed ſo exactly by any man, as it may be by his law, which repreſents unto us the image of his minde, and will, and gives us a more diſtinct knowledge of him then his works can doe. Nay, his word ſerves as a Commentary to his works, as laying before us the rule, according to which God orders all his ways: ſo that by the help thereof, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the righteouſneſſe and holineſſe of all his acts, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 73.17. which he could not finde out before. It is true indeed, that the very works themſelves praiſe God, and ſhew him in his tender mercies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.5.8. in his mighty power, <hi>Job</hi> 36.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 37.23. &amp; Godhead, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 1.20. yea commonly in his righteouſneſs, in rewarding, and puniſhing, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 58.11. But they neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe him ſo diſtinctly, nor conſequently affect the heart ſo deeply, as they doe when they are il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by the word, as <hi>Job</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>chap.</hi> 42.6. that he never ſaw God ſo clearly, nor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred himſelf ſo much, as when God deſcribed unto him his works, in that conference, <hi>Job</hi> 38. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore ſeeing the image of God is moſt exactly expreſſed unto us in the word, it is moſt fit that the word, that repreſents him to us, ſhould be given by God himſelf, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf beſt, can give us the moſt perfect draught of his own face. Beſides theſe reſpects unto Gods honour, in regard of mans good, it was not convenient that the Scriptures which

<note place="margin">2. To make his ſervices accepted.</note> nothing can make our ſervices, performed to God, or man, to be duties of obedience, but the undertaking of them upon Gods command, which we do, when we know the precept that preſcribes them to be the voice and word of himſelf. Laſtly,
<note place="margin">3.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108952:23"/>been left uncertain, both of the acceptance of his ſervices, and of the aſſurance of his rewards, if the law, that requireth the one, and promiſeth the other, were not given by God himſelf, the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we undertook to prove, muſt needs remain firm and infallible, that none could or was fit to be the Author of the Scriptures, wherin the law of God is contained, but onely God himſelf.</p>

The ſecond is, the ſubject or matters which the Scriptures handle, which are many times beyond the compaſſe of mans reaſon to finde out, and therefore muſt be revealed by God himſelf.

                           <p>SAint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. proves unto the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> that his Miniſtery was of God, becauſe it carried with it great power and authority, in ſimplicity and plainneſſe of ſpeech. Majeſty, is for the moſt part a character of power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and that ſo lively, that it is not eaſily counterfeited. Outward ornaments grace it nor much,
<note place="margin">The Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of the Scriptures manifeſts them to be Gods Word. 1. In the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, void of art yet full of power.</note> neither doth the want of them much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure it. And it is therein like unto light, ſimple indeed, but yet ſo beautifull and glorious in it ſelf, that the addition of any colour, rather ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſheth then adorneth it; ſuch is the Majeſty of the Scriptures ſtyle, nothing is more plain, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the moſt part void of the ornaments of art, and eloquence, and yet appears ſo full of Majeſty, to ſuch as well obſerve it, that it moves awe and reverence in the heart. It is true, that this Majeſty is not ſo eaſily diſcovered in every phraſe, and clauſe of a ſentence, but is moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted in the whole frame and compoſure of thoſe holy writings. As the Majeſty of a mans countenance is not ſo fully diſcovered in any one part of the face, as in the whole viſage taken joyntly together.</p>
                           <p>Of this Majeſty whereof we now ſpeak, it wil be more eaſie to give an inſtance then a proof, ſeeing it can be no otherwiſe diſcovered then light is, by the very view of it ſelf: Any man, that advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108952:24"/>reads the Scriptures, may eaſily obſerve ſuch weight in the words and phraſes of ſpeech, and ſhall meet with ſuch high and unuſuall, and yet plain and ſignificant expreſſions, in divers paſſages of that book, that he ſhall be enforced to acknowledge, that which the Phariſees ſervants ſent to apprehend our Saviour reported of him, that never man ſpake like that man, <hi>John</hi> 7.46. And yet withall, this ſeems to be ſome probable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch a Majeſty in the ſtyle of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that it ſo ſtrangely ſuits with thoſe high myſteries which are handled in that book, that it cannot well be fitted to any other ſubject. So that if thoſe divine truths be expreſſed in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a Scripture phraſe, they ſeeme to loſe much of their luſtre and beauty; and if that phraſe be applyed to any other ſubject, then thoſe holy myſteries, it ſeems like <hi>Sauls</hi> armour on a childes back, or a parable in a fools mouth, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.7.</p>
                           <p>Now then as a mans countenance diſcovers in ſome meaſure, the ſpirit that is within him, (as a Prince, and ſome baſe abject having a diverſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, a different comportment, another kinde of ſtyle or phraſe of ſpeech, are judged to have a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpirit within, from which thoſe outward effects proceed, the one baſe and abject, the other heroicall and generous) ſo the Majeſty of that high and lofty ſtyle, wherein the Scriptures are written, diſcovers a divine ſpirit full of Majeſty and power, which ſtamps that character upon them. But this Majeſty with which the Scripture
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108952:24"/>ſpeaks, beſides the bare phraſe and ſtyle, will bee yet farther manifeſted, by that ſtrange and unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner of commanding, with great Authority and power, which we find frequent in that book, far different from the commands of men, as will appear eaſily in theſe enſuing circumſtances.</p>
                           <p>He that reads a law, which neither intreats,
<note place="margin">2. In the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands.</note> nor perſwades, but preſcribes and commands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives preſently that he hears the voice of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: But when he obſerves, that the command is not to all alike, but is delivered with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reſpects to men, according to their ſeverall ſtates and degrees, and that it extends not to all men in generall, but onely to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of ſuch a Country, or members of ſuch a Society, he muſt needs withall diſcern it to bee the voice, not of a ſupream, tranſcendent, and abſolute, but onely of ſome limited and bounded power, extending neither to all, nor to thoſe which are ſubject to it, indifferently and equally. But when in Gods book he reads a law delivered in another form, propoſed to the whole world,
<note place="margin">1. Given to the whole world, and without reſpect of perſons.</note> without any limitation of Country, Nation, or State, how can he conceive otherwiſe, but that he hears the voice of a tranſcendent power, that extends it ſelf over all the world? And when he findes Kings and Beggers ſpoken of, and to, in the ſame phraſe of ſpeech, without reſpect or reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of honour, or diſtinction of degrees, how can he chuſe but fixe his thoughts on that infinite Majeſty, before which rich and poor, Prince and Subject, are all alike, becauſe they are all the work
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108952:25"/>of his hands, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Iob</hi> 34.19.</p>
                           <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the very thoughts.</note> we ſee that the commands of the greateſt earthly Potentates, reach no farther then the ordering of mens outward converſation, but extend not to the ordering of the motions or thoughts of the heart, whence it is that we uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſay (and juſtly may in reſpect of humane laws) that thoughts are free. So then, when we ſee that men dare not take upon them the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of mens thoughts, by any law, wee muſt needs ſuppoſe that they acknowledge, that their power reacheth not to the minde and ſpirit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they can give no laws, becauſe they cannot know when they are broken or obeyed. But God in his word gives laws to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and commands the thoughts, and inward motions of the minde, requiring to love God with all the heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37. and ones neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our ſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 39. and forbidding luſt, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, malice, &amp;c. and other inordinate motions of the minde, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.28. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. Which neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily implies, that he that gives ſuch laws is the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.16. the ſearcher of the hearts, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.10. able therefore to know, and judge the obedience, or rebellion of the very thoughts of the ſoul and ſpirit.</p>
                           <p>In the third place,
<note place="margin">3. Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to creatures out of mans power and command.</note> we muſt needs grant, that though no creature be exempted from mans ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, yet there are many of them that are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his command, as being without his reach, or too great to be maſtered by his power; ſuch are the heavens, with all their hoſts, the earth, the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108952:25"/>ſeas; the windes, &amp;c. which the Lord himſelf ſeems to have reſerved to his own juriſdiction. Hence it was, that thoſe that thought our Saviour to be but a meer man, wondred to hear him rebuke the windes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.26, 27. a thing that no meer man, well adviſed, ever did. As for <hi>Ioſhua's</hi> words to the Sun and Moon, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 10.12. they have indeed the form of a command, but had onely the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a prayer, ſo that the Lord, and not the Sun heard <hi>Ioſhua, ver.</hi> 13. Seeing therefore men forbear to command the heavens, earth, ſeas, windes, &amp;c. and in Scriptures wee finde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and bounds given to the ſeas, <hi>Iob</hi> 38.11. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 104.79. the earth fixed to a place, by Gods decree, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.90. his word ſetled in heaven, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.89. the windes, fire, hail, ſnow, &amp;c. fulfilling his word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.8. we muſt needs acknowledge, that the voice that commands all theſe, is the word of that powerfull Lord; who having made all theſe things, hath right and power to command and give laws unto them according to his pleaſure.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, no man well adviſed,
<note place="margin">4. Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſanctions of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and threats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond mans power.</note> ever took upon him to threaten thoſe things that were beyond mans power to effect, and therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that reacheth onely to mens outward eſtate and no farther, and that too limited to the bounds of this preſent life, we never finde mens ſanctions, given in their laws, extended beyond the promiſes or threats of preſent, or outward good: or evill: as for inſtance, either to give or take away mens liberty, their wealth, or eſtates, or life at the moſt. But Gods word threatens plagues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108952:26"/>on the ſoul, hardneſſe of heart, a reprobate ſenſe, a trembling ſpirit, a ſpirit of madneſſe, and giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and promiſeth light of knowledge, power of faith, encreaſe of grace, &amp;c. nay, reacheth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this life, to eternity, threatning the wicked with the worm that dieth not, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.24. everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. everlaſting chains, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. and promiſing an inheritance immortall, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. a Kingdome that fadeth not, Rivers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in Gods preſence for evermore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. Such promiſes and ſuch threatnings which exceed the limits of any mortall power to beſtow or inflict, muſt needs be acknowledged to proceed from the God of ſpirits and eternity.</p>
                           <p>Lay all theſe particulars together, and thus we may frame the argument, drawn from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which we finde in Scripture, to prove it to be the word of God. That voice which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and gives laws to the whole world, and that without reſpect of perſons, that preſcribes and gives rules to the thoughts of the heart, that promiſeth and threatneth rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the ſoul, and that eternally, that gives laws to thoſe creatures, over which no man had, or ever challenged any power, the heavens, earth, ſeas, windes, &amp;c. that muſt needs be the voice and word of God; But ſuch is the voice that ſpeaks in the Scriptures, therefore the Scriptures muſt needs be acknowledged to be the voice and word of God. Thus the Majeſty of the Scriptures manifeſted in their lofty plain ſtyle, and in their tranſcendent commands, and ſanctions, diſcover
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108952:26"/>theſe ſacred volumes, to be the word of him to whom alone belongs Majeſty, Authority, and Power.</p>

                           <p>To begin with the moſt eminent object of faith,
<note place="margin">1. God himſelf.</note> God himſelf. No man hath ſeen him at any time,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108952:27"/>
                              <hi>John</hi> 1.18. neither conſequently knows him as he ought, as our Saviour teſtifies, <hi>John</hi> 17.25. much leſſe can manifeſt him unto others. Indeed, that God is, yea his Godhead and power are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the works of Creation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. But how little true knowledge of God is diſcovered to naturall men by that way of groping, as the Apoſtle tearms it, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.27. appears by the writings of the moſt learned amongſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then (to omit the phantaſies of the reſt) who ſpeak ſo little, and ſo uncertainly concerning God, that they ſeem like the blinde man, whoſe eyes were not yet fully cleared by our Saviour, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.24. who ſaw men walking like trees. Neither indeed are their writings, compared with the Scriptures, revealing the glory of God in the face of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. ſo much as the light of a candle to the Sun ſhining at noon day. As for the myſtery of the Trinity, it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acknowledged to bee a ſecret, unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by naturall reaſon, or diſcoverable any way but by the revelation of the Word and Spirit.</p>
                           <p>Next unto God,
<note place="margin">2. The Creation of the world, with the manner &amp; order of it.</note> may follow the Creation of the world, which we likewiſe beleeve by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. which although the Heathen, upon the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the creatures, by the light of naturall reaſon, were forced to acknowledge, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that it muſt be the work of a God: yet that the creatures were made by Gods meere word, finiſhed in ſixe days, and created in ſuch order as we finde mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. no Heathen man ever took upon him to relate: neither (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108952:27"/>man was made the laſt of all creatures) was it poſſible for him to divine, what was done before he had any beeing; wherefore the Scriptures, ſo exactly deſcribing the time, means, and order of the Creation, muſt needs be the Word of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Father, who was brought forth ere the mountains were ſetled, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.25. preſent when he prepared the heavens, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. by his Father when he appointed the foundations of the earth, <hi>ver.</hi> 29, 30.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, the ſtate of man before his fall,
<note place="margin">3.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108952:28"/>they reveal theſe things that cannot be taught by humane reaſon.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">4. Mans Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt.</note> that wonderfull myſtery of mans Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, being a ſecret that never entred into mans heart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.19. was never ſo much as dreamed of by any naturall man, neither doe we finde the leaſt ſyllable of it in any Heathen mans bookes. The truth is, it ſeems ſo incredible a thing to fleſh and blood, that the Prophet, not without cauſe, when he begins to ſpeak of this wonder, asks, who hath beleeved his report? <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.1. and the Apoſtle tels us, that when it was preached, the learned Grecians ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it fooliſhneſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27. or a meere phantaſie. Now that which ſeems incredible to reaſon, when it is known, was very unlikely to be found out by reaſon at the firſt, before it was known. If there were no more but this, that this wonderfull work proceeded meerly from the free motion of Gods will, without any other cauſe moving thereinto, then his own love and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, as Chriſt himſelf affirms, <hi>Iohn</hi> 36.16. And the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.10. how could any man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, what God purpoſed in his own heart before he had wrought it, unleſſe himſelf had revealed it? So that it muſt needs be granted, that this word which ſets out unto us the myſtery of our Redemption by Chriſt, muſt be the Word of God himſelf.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">5. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits thereof.</note> the condition into which man is redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Chriſt, is another myſtery, hidden from the eyes of all that ſee by no clearer light, then
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108952:28"/>that which naturall reaſon yeelds them. It was utterly impoſſible for any man,
<note place="margin">Unio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Chriſt. Adoption. Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> by the light of nature, to have diſcovered our myſticall union into one body with Chriſt, by the Spirit; our adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by grace to be the ſons of God; our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith, through the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe; our Renovation or new birth, wherein our hearts are changed by the effectuall working of the ſpirit;
<note place="margin">Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our bodies to glory.</note> the reſtitution of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to life again, with a change from the ſtate of corruption to incorruption, of naturall, and earthly bodies, to ſpirituall, and heavenly, and our glorious, and ever bleſſed condition to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed hereafter, in the immediate, and everlaſting fruition of God in the higheſt heavens. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we finde not ſo much as any mention of theſe things among any of the Heathen, unleſſe perhaps they ſtumble upon the immortality of the ſoul, which yet they rather dream of, then underſtand diſtinctly. Wherefore the Scriptures revealing unto us ſo clearly all theſe things which naturall reaſon could neither teach nor compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, muſt needs be acknowledged to be the Word of God.</p>
                           <p>It appears then hitherto,
<note place="margin">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Many rules of life. 1. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the heart toward God in fear, love, &amp; faith.</note> that the principles of faith, laid down in the Scriptures, muſt needs be acknowledged to be revealed by God, and not by man. The ſame truth will be evidently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, in the rules of practiſe, if they be duly weighed. To begin with the duties to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto God, and firſt with the affections and right diſpoſition of the heart. The Apoſtle tels us,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108952:29"/>we cannot beleeve on him of vvhom vve have not heard, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. and the Pſalmiſt affirms, that they onely truſt in him, that know his name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. and we know that it was the lively repreſentation of God unto him, that ſtrook that deep impreſſion of fear into <hi>Iobs</hi> heart, and made him vile in his own eyes,

The truth is, thoſe holy affections of love, fear, and affiance in God, cannot be grounded on any other, then a true, and diſtinct knowledge of him, which, as we have ſeen already, the light of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reaſon could never diſcover: ſo that none can preſcribe unto us the right diſpoſing of the heart towards God, in thoſe holy affections of love, fear, and faith in him, but the ſame that can reveal unto us the right knowledge of himſelf.</p>
                           <p>As for the outward duties of worſhip,
<note place="margin">2.

Wherefore we finde that thoſe forms of worſhip which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the wiſeſt amongſt them either took from the <hi>Sibylls</hi> books, or from ſome other directions pretended to be given by the Gods themſelves. Neither can we poſſibly be aſſured that ſuch rites, as we worſhip God withall,
<note place="margin">In the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, uſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, &amp;c.</note> are accepted, unleſſe God himſelf preſcribe them, as we ſee he did the whole form of ceremoniall worſhip in the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall law, and the Sabbath, and Sacraments, both in Paradiſe, and under the Goſpel by our Saviour Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>And for the ſervices which are to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108952:29"/>to men, firſt, we finde little in the Precepts of ſuch as are meer Moraliſts, concerning that fountain of thoſe duties, whence they ought to flow, which is love, without which none of them is accepted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. Neither doe we finde that meaſure of love required by them, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour commands, to love our neighbour as our ſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. wherein he affirms we go beyond naturall men, and conſequently implies that we doe more then naturall reaſon teacheth, whence it will follow, that the law which requires that duty, was not given by man, and therefore muſt needs be acknowledged to be the Precept and Word of God, and not of man.</p>
                           <p>Nay, beyond all this,
<note place="margin">3. Moſt of all ſelf-deniall, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture never taught.</note> we find that Gods Word requires of us the deniall of our ſelves, and that every way, both of our own vviſdome to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, (as the Lord requires his people to do not vvhat is right in their own eyes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.8. but what is right in the eyes of the Lord their God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.18.) and of our own ability to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and perform, (as our Saviour requires us to bring forth fruit in him, vvithout vvhom vve can doe nothing, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.5.) and of our own ends, (as the Apoſtle tels us, that vve muſt bring forth fruit unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. that he may be glorified, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. and therefore the Prophet cals <hi>Iſrael</hi> an empty Vine, becauſe he brought forth fruit to himſelf, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.1.) whence it is, that our Saviour makes this ſelf-deniall, the firſt ſtep to Religion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. A duty that humane reaſon is ſo far from preſcribing, that it cannot ſo much as allow
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108952:30"/>and ſubmit unto it when it is preſcribed, and that becauſe it cannot finde out mans emptineſſe and weakneſſe, the ground on which ſelf-deniall is founded, or at leaſt ſenſibly acknowledged. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scriptures, which require that duty, which is ſo contrary to the principles of nature, muſt needs be the Word of God.</p>
                           <p>Thus we ſee, that the ſubject which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures handle, is above the pitch of humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whether vve look to the grounds of faith, or rules of practiſe, which are layed down there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The true knowledge of God vvhom the world hath not known: the great and glorious works of the worlds Creation, vvith the time, manner, and order thereof: And of mans Redemption after his fall, and corruption thereby; together with the ſtate into which he is redeemed, to be myſtically united to Chriſt, by the Spirit, which gives him intereſt in his merits and righteouſneſſe, makes him Gods childe by adoption, and an heir of glory. The duties of fear, love, and affiance in God, all grounded on the true knowledge of him; And laſtly, the ſervice of love to man, binding him to love his neighbour as himſelf, yea, his very enemies, and above all things to deny himſelf. So that the Scripture diſcovering thoſe things, which naturall reaſon could never finde out, muſt needs be acknowledged to be delivered by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to be his Word.</p>

<note place="margin">The grounds of ſpirituall terrours.</note> and fear of the puniſhment that follows it, the cauſes that affect a godly mans heart, differ in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the terrour raiſed in a good mans heart, by the Word, is for ſins of another nature, then are thoſe that trouble naturall men.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                              <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> they are affected by them on different conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Gods revenging hand: For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, a naturall man is uſually ſenſible onely of ſins againſt the law of Nature,
<note place="margin">1. Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the ſins of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, pride, &amp;c.</note> and eſpecially ſins againſt the ſecond Table. But the Word of God repreſents unto a man chiefly, more ſecret and inward evils, infidelity, pride, ſelf-love, ſenſuall affections, hypocriſie, hardneſſe of heart, and the like, and cauſeth them to appear unto him the fouleſt, and moſt abominable of all kinds of ſin, that can be committed.</p>
                           <p>In the ſecond place,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that which affects a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man in ſin, is either ſomething that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the ſinne, as ſhame, or danger of wrath and vengeance, of which <hi>Cain</hi> complains, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.14. or the ſin, as it is a treſpaſſe againſt man, and a wrong done to him, which affects him more then the ſenſe of any diſhonour done to God, as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was ſenſible of nothing, but betraying inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.4. But when Gods Word ſmites the heart, it repreſents to the guilty perſon, his treſpaſſe againſt God, his Majeſty,
<note place="margin">2. And thoſe as treſpaſſes againſt God.</note> and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which affected <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.4. His unkinde and cauſleſſe treſpaſſing againſt the God that

By all which he hath defiled his own ſoul, is become like the beaſts that periſh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.20. nay, worſe then they, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3. ſo that he loaths, and is aſhamed of himſelf, <hi>Iob</hi> 42.6. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.19.</p>
                           <p>Now as the conſiderations in ſin,
<note place="margin">3. And fear of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.</note> that affect men naturally, and ſpiritually, are divers, ſo are the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the danger, that comes by ſin; A naturall mans fears are like that of <hi>Belſhazar, Dan.</hi> 5.6. ſomething he trembled at, but what it was he underſtood not, or like thoſe terrours threatned, <hi>Deu.</hi> 28.65, 66. wherin they ſhal fear day &amp; night, they know not why. But the Word of God ſhews one the cauſe of his fear, repreſenting the purity of thoſe eyes of jealouſie, which he hath provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, makes it evident that God will by no means pardon the guilty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. that he cannot be beguiled, will not be intreated, is impoſſible to be eſcaped, and yet cannot be endured, as ſmiting with the arm of God, and not of man: whoſe breath, as a river of brimſtone, kindles that pile of fire and much wood, which God prepares for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108952:32"/>ſinners, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.33. whoſe worm dieth not, neither doth their fire goe out, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.24. So that by the Word the ſinner ſees the rod, and who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.9. and feels it in his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion certain, preſent, intolerable, and eternal: which compaſſeth him ſo with terrours, that he knows not what to doe, unleſſe he can make his peace with God, and procure his pardon.</p>
                           <p>Hence it follows,
<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of theſe ſeveraſl kindes of paſſions. In naturall men aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, fretting, hatred of God. In ſpiritual me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhame, grief for offending God, fear of loſſe of his favour. laſtly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation what to doe.</note> that as naturall and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all terrours are raiſed upon different grounds: ſo the effects and conſequents of them muſt needs be divers, which was propoſed to be handled in the next place. For naturall terrours produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but aſtoniſhment and amazedneſſe, ſo that ſuch men lye down in their confuſion, fretting with indignation, and murmuring in their hearts, at their condition, with <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.13. and both fearing God, and hating him. On the other ſide, the terrours raiſed by Gods Word, in the heart, produce withall a loathing of ones ſelf, as a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy creature, ſhame of ones own vileneſſe, griefe as much for his unkindneſſe towards God, as for his miſery by ſin; fear of the loſſe of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as much as of his revenging hand, indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at ones own folly, and wickedneſſe, ſtill acknowledging the Juſtice and Righteouſneſſe of God, which produceth at laſt deliberation what to doe, with the Prodigall ſon, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17, 18.</p>
                           <p>So then, naturall terrours break, theſe melt the heart: naturall terrours are mixed with pride, theſe produce abaſement of the ſpirit: Naturall terrours cauſe repining at God, theſe indignation
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108952:33"/>at a mans ſelf: Naturall terrours drive one, from; theſe, unto God, to ſue for peace, the former force him into the mouth of hell: theſe caſt him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the boſome of Chriſt, with uncertain hopes at firſt, and with a trembling heart, as the Lepers adventured on the <hi>Syrians</hi> camp, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.4. yet with hope of ſome poſſibility to finde favour, and with a reſolution to caſt himſelf upon God, come what will; Such kinde of heart-breakings which are wrought by the Word, being impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be wrought by any naturall means, argue that word that cauſeth them to be of God, who worketh according to his own pleaſure, in all things, what he will.</p>
                           <p>Thus the firſt work of the Scripture,
<note place="margin">The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall effect of the Word, converſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1<hi rend="sup">t</hi> The means whereof are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Word; ſhewing,</note> in pricking and wounding the heart, manifeſtly diſcovers it to be the Word of God, as working beyond the power of nature: But the converſion of the ſoul, by the ſame Word, will make it yet more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Now it appears, <hi>firſt,</hi> by the means of his converſion, and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> by the nature and kind of the work it ſelfe. The means by which the Word draws on the heart towards this work of converſion, are by propoſing unto one caſt down, by the ſight of ſin, and ſenſe of Gods wrath, two grounds, without which that work of converſion cannot be brought to effect.
<note place="margin">1. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to work our peace.</note> Firſt, the unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe, and inability of all creatures to help, in that dangerous condition, in which he findes himſelf.

                           <pb n="39" facs="tcp:108952:33"/>
                           <p>The inability of the creatures to doe us good in this caſe, is onely manifeſted by Gods Word,
<note place="margin">1. Of our ſelves to ſatisfie for ſins paſſed.</note> which makes it evident, that we cannot help our ſelves neither by flight from Gods preſence, which fils all places, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 139.7. nor by reſiſting his power, which would be like the encounter of the thorns with the ſire, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.4. nor by intreating &amp; making peace with him, who will by no means clear the guilty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. without ſatisfaction, which we cannot make in our own perſons, neither by our wealth, which is no ranſome for ſouls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.7,
<note place="margin">Either by ourwealth, of by our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. 2.

All other creatures we finde in the ſame condition with our ſelves, debtors to God for all that they have or can doe, and therefore unable to ſatisfie for us, and as unable to defend us from Gods power,
<note place="margin">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the onely way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our peace Chriſt Jeſus. 1. Holy in himſelf. 2.

                           <p>The heart of a ſinner, being by this means brought to deſpair of help unto ſalvation by any creature, the Word points out unto him that fountain which God hath opened for ſin and for uncleanneſſe, Chriſt Jeſus himſelf, the only Son of his Father, the holy one, in whoſe mouth no guile was found, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.9. In whom God is well pleaſed, who was bruiſed for our iniquities, ſo far that God did ſee the travell of his ſoul, and was ſatisfied, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12. and who in our fleſh ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all righteouſneſſe, and that for us. This
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108952:34"/>means of reconciliation,
<note place="margin">4. Tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us by God himſelf.</note> the Scripture tels us God offers to all that will embrace it, and that upon his faithfull Word, which is truth it ſelf, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.142.151. Yea, makes it manifeſt that this mercy is of ineſtimable value, and beyond belief, yet that it becomes God to doe things incredible, to cauſe his mercies to exceed, not onely the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of men, but even mans apprehenſion, as the love of Chriſt paſſeth knowledge, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. that all men may be aſtoniſhed at the conſideration of his mercies, as well as of his judgments, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of all his ways, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33.</p>
                           <p>Thus Gods Word ſhews,
<note place="margin">A means, 1. Suiting with Gods Juſtice. 2. Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his Mercy. 3.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108952:34"/>leſſe could the act it ſelf of converſion, be wrought by any other inſtrument, then the ſame Word.

Or how is it poſſible that corrupt nature ſhould conquer it ſelf? Indeed, it is true that naturall wiſdome hath prevailed upon men, to change them from a vicious diſpoſition, to morall hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, perhaps ſomewhat out of conſcience, or more out of ſelf-reſpect, to grace themſelves by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a vertuous diſpoſition, but to deny ones ſelf, one cannot be poſſibly perſwaded, but by ſomething that is not himſelf.</p>
                           <p>Again,
<note place="margin">2.

For that Gods deſires ſhould be our deſires, his will our will, his delights our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights (our wiſdome in this ſtate of corruption being enmity againſt him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7.) can bee

Now the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and new creating of the heart is beyond mans power, effected onely by him that made it at the firſt; wherefore, even in reſpect of our new birth we are ſaid to be his workmanſhip, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. receiving this ſpirituall, as well as our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life from him, to whom it properly belongs to quicken the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. to raiſe up whom he will, <hi>John</hi> 5.21. as having life in himſelf: <hi>v.</hi> 26. wherefore the renuing of the heart, being a work above nature, and properly the effect of a divine power; it neceſſarily follows, that the Scriptures, which are found by experience to be the inſtruments of that high and ſupernaturall work, muſt have a divine original, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the Word of God.</p>
                           <p>The laſt of the divine and ſupernaturall effects,
<note place="margin">The third ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall effect of the Word, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving wounded ſpirits.

Now that this can be effected by no other means then the Word, is manifeſt not only by experience, which makes it evident that humane wiſdome or eloquence can doe nothing to purpoſe this way: but beſides, by the conſideration of the cauſe whence the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of the ſpirit ariſeth. For ſeeing it is the apprehenſion of Gods wrath, provoked by ſin, that breaks the heart, it muſt needs be granted that it cannot be healed, but upon a perſwaſion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108952:35"/>that God is pacified, as we ſee in that wounded ſpirit, <hi>Job</hi> 33.25. and in <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. which muſt be wrought by a meſſage comming from God himſelf, as it is God that muſt cauſe <hi>David</hi> to hear the voice of joy and gladneſſe, ere the bones that he had broken could rejoyce, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.8. It muſt therefore be the ſame hand that hath ſmitten, that muſt heal, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.1. wherefore ſeeing it is onely Gods Word that wounds the ſoul, as hath been ſhewed; the Word that reſtores and heals it, muſt needs be granted to be the ſame Word of God.</p>

                     <p>The former Poſition being once granted, that the Scriptures are Gods Word, no man can queſtion their Authority, whether that be of him or no. So that this evident truth, needing no power at all, our labour muſt be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhew, what we mean by that divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which we challenge unto the Scriptures; for the opening whereof, we muſt <hi>firſt,</hi> conſider in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, what this name <hi>Authority</hi> imports. In Scripture, as well as in other Authors, the names
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108952:37"/>of Authority and Power are uſed indifferently,
<note place="margin">Authority is not Power in genetall,</note> as if they were one and the ſame thing, although in ſtrictneſſe of ſignification, we may finde a reall difference between them. For this tearm Power, implies that ſtrength by which any thing not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſiſts, but withall bears out it ſelfe againſt whatſoever oppoſeth it, and beſides is enabled to work any notable effect; but this ſignification as making little to our purpoſe, we ſhall omit for the preſent.</p>
                     <p>More pertinently to the matter in hand,
<note place="margin">But right to rule &amp; govern.</note> this name of Power is taken for that dominion and right of ruling, and governing, which one hath over another, to diſpoſe and order that which is governed. In this ſenſe Power ſeems to bee a more generall name then Authority, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the correlative tearms oppoſed thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For ſubjection (which imports any kind of ſubordination of one under another) ſeems moſt firly to anſwer to Power, as the Pſalmiſt match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mans dominion over the works of Gods hands, with ſubjection or putting all things under his feet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.6. And obedience, which is a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily yeelding or ſubmitting ones ſelfe to anothers will, may bee conceived to bee more properly correſpondent to Authority, as the Centurion expreſſeth the ſubjection of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and ſoldiers, by their readineſſe to doe his will, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.8. At leaſt howſoever the names be ſometimes uſed indifferently, there is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt difference between preſcribing to a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature, and between the diſpoſing of that which is without reaſon.</p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:108952:37"/>
                     <p>Authority therefore,

By right, in this deſcription, we exclude tyranny, which is the uſurping of authority, without or againſt right. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when we place the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Authority in preſcribing,
<note place="margin">As being only capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</note> we imply that it properly extends onely to ſuch as are capable of preſcription, which are reaſonable creatures. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> we extend it to all kinde of preſcribing, both to the underſtanding, what to aſſent unto and beleeve, and to the will, what to follow and embrace. All which particulars, if we lay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, we ſhall finde that Authority originally is founded in God alone, and that men have no title unto it, but by deputation from him, as the Apoſtle expreſly reſtifieth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1.
<note place="margin">Which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, 1. To the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, what to beleeve.

                     </p>
                     <p>To begin with that branch of Authority that preſcribes unto the underſtanding, what to aſſent unto as truth, we know that this is a Power that no man may juſtly challenge, ſeeing a rule muſt be certain; now mans underſtanding we know is capable of error, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. and that for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> mans knowledge is not by viſion, or looking through the nature of things themſelves, but by information from ſenſe, which repreſents onely the outward appearance, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. and leaves reaſon to gueſſe at the inward nature of things, wherein there cannot but be much uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſeeing it is light which makes all things manifeſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.13. which none hath
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108952:38"/>originally in himſelf but God alone, who dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the light, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. nay, is light it ſelfe, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.5. and therefore men can have no light but by communication from God, who illightens every one that comes into the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9. it muſt needs follow, that man can have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of judgement, becauſe he judgeth by that light which is not in his own power, but is ſupplied or withheld according to the will of God, who diſpoſeth it, at his pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Now then, men having no infallibility of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in themſelves, muſt neceſſarily reſt upon ſomething without themſelves for a certain rule of truth,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which muſt needs be God alone. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe onely God both is light in himſelf, as we have ſhewed, and withall is in and through all things, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.6. which are therefore ſaid to be naked in his ſight, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. as will be farther ſhewed hereafter.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> becauſe hee is a God that cannot lie,
<note place="margin">3. And ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie.</note> 
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. being a God of truth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.2. nay, truth it ſelf, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.6. and conſequently may be reſted on, as an infallible oracle of truth, an honour peculiar to God, and incommunicable to any creature. So that the firſt branch of Authority, which is the power and right of giving rules of truth, belongs to God alone, and cannot be challenged by any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>The next branch of Authority,
<note place="margin">2 To the will. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to God only.</note> is the right of preſcribing to the will, which muſt alſo be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated unto God onely, and that on three grounds. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe it can be no otherwiſe, for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108952:38"/>ſeeing both man and all creatures have their bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not onely originally from God,
<note place="margin">1. Becauſe it moves In and By him, and therefore muſt have the rule of moving From him.</note> but beſides in him by continuall ſupport, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. it muſt follow, that they can move no otherwiſe, nor no longer then his power aſſiſts them, no more then the ſtaffe can doe without the force of the hand that uſeth it: which alſo is true of all other creatures, that they are turned about by his counſell to doe what he wils, <hi>Iob</hi> 37.12. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 148.8. So that, as all other creatures, ſo man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt muſt of neceſſity have the rule of his motions from Gods will.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is not more neceſſary then equall,
<note place="margin">2. He only hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to doe with his own what he will.</note> that it ſhould be ſo, becauſe of the totall and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute dependence that man hath upon God eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, for it is juſt that one may do with his own what he wil, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15. which alſo the very principles of nature teach all men, as appears by ſubjecting children to the will of their parents, on whom notwithſtanding they depend neither totally, nor principally. Nay this equity is much greater in man, then in any other creature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the acknowledgement of Gods will in all things to be moſt juſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.128. by ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſubſcribing thereunto, and thereby to himſelf to be a God without iniquity, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4. is the main end for which man was created, and endowed with underſtanding, and with a will to be directed by it, and there is great reaſon the workman ſhould uſe his tool to that end for which he made it.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, it is every way convenient that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108952:39"/>God ſhould preſcribe to mens will,
<note place="margin">3. It is beſt that Gods will ſhould be our rule. 1<hi rend="sup">t</hi> For men in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; ſeeing his will is onely infallibly, 1. Good. 2.

For men in particular it is better, becauſe Gods will firſt is abſolutely good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.10. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as mens are evill. Secondly, is conſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 33.11. whereas mens are variable every moment. And thirdly, the following of Gods direction in our ways aſſures us, both of ſucceſſe in our endeavours, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 1.8. and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of our ſervice, when we know we doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what God himſelf commands. And as for the generall adminiſtration of the world, it muſt needs be every way moſt convenient, that God preſcribe unto all men, that when all are guided by one rule, order and unity might be preſerved. Laſtly, how Gods honour is furthered, when his laws paſſe for rules of practiſe, without contradiction, and by mens ſubmiſſion thereunto are acknowledged to be holy and juſt, hath been partly intimated before.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto then it appears, that divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reacheth to the preſcribing, and giving rules to the two moſt eminent faculties in man, the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and Will, what to beleeve, embrace, and proſecute. A power which he hath right unto by the abſolute ſoveraignty which he hath overall things, by the infallibility of his truth; and laſtly, by the unchangeable righteouſneſſe and goodnes of his wil. All which laid together, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily infer, that abſolute Authority is founded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally in God, and in him alone. It hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108952:39"/>him notwithſtanding to impart this power of his to men,
<note place="margin">This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in himſelfe imparts to men.</note> whom he hath made his ſubſtitutes on earth, but within certain bounds and limits, this limited Authority committed by God to men, is for diſtinction ſake called humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as that abſolute Authority from which it is derived, is called divine. What either of theſe are, and by what limits they are ſevered, will beſt appear by laying their differences one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
                     <p>The firſt difference between divine and humane Authority, is in the fountain, whence they ſpring;
<note place="margin">Diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power 1. In the fountain, Gods is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally in himſelf; Mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him.</note> Gods Authority is founded in himſelf, mans in God. Therefore Gods affirmation or command muſt be received without contradiction, though we underſtand neither reaſon why, nor end wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſo that to ſilence our very thoughts, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſay, The Lord hath ſpoken it: but when men affirm or command, we cry, To the law and to the teſtimony, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. wherewith if their commands or aſſertions agree not, there is no light in them, ſo that we may warrantably except, with the Apoſtles, Whether it be meet to obey God or men judge ye, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.19. So then, the firſt difference is this, that Authority that preſcribes by the abſolute power of the commander is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that which preſcribes by vertue of another under whom it commands, is humane.
<note place="margin">2. In the ſubject matters preſcribed. 1. Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of faith.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond difference between the Authority of God and man, is in reſpect of the ſubjects, or matters preſcribed, which are either principles of ſaith, or rules of life; for the former, becauſe

So that in matters of faith there is no infallibility in mans knowledge, and that which is, depends upon the credit not of the man, but of the Spirit which reveals it. Another reaſon why mans teſtimony is no ſufficient ground of faith,
<note place="margin">2. Becauſe men may lye.</note> is becauſe men may deceive as well as be deceived, wherefore though they often ſpeake truth, we are not ſure that they doe ſo always, becauſe it is not contrary to their nature to lye,
<note place="margin">Whereas Gods knowledg is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 1. Becauſe he hath light in himſelf. 2. And knows by viſion, not by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> as it is unto Gods, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2.</p>
                     <p>Neither of theſe imperfections are found in God, whoſe knowledge muſt needs be every way perfect, becauſe he ſees by his own, not by a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed light, which muſt therefore be without any mixture of darkneſſe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.5. And, becauſe the means of Gods knowledge is by viſion, not by diſcourſe, yea, by ſuch a ſight as pierceth through the very nature of all things, ſeeing God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is in and through all, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.6. Beſides, the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108952:40"/>moſt of the things which we beleeve,
<note place="margin">3. And muſt needs underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what he freely gives.</note> are things freely given us of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt needs underſtand fully, ſeeing the ſpirit in man underſtands the things of a man, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no man elſe know them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. Now in the next place, there can be no more queſtion of Gods fidelity in revealing, then there is of his infallibility in underſtanding all things, ſeeing truth is Gods nature,
<note place="margin">And can no more deceive then be deceived.</note> which therefore he can no more ſwerve from, then from himſelf. So ſeeing we finde Gods teſtimony every way infallible, and mans uncertain, it muſt needs be granted that it is peculiar to God alone to eſtabliſh grounds of faith.</p>
                     <p>Againe, for the regulating of mans practiſe,
<note place="margin">2. And rules of life onely to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by God. 1. Whoſe will is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly good. 2. And the duties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed are his ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> there is a wide difference between Gods and mans Authority; for if we reſpect the ſubſtance of duty, that can be preſcribed by none but God alone, both becauſe onely his will is infallibly good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.10.119.39. and therefore only fit to be the rule of righteouſneſſe; and beſides, becauſe the duties commanded, being all of them immediately, or mediately ſervices unto God, it was moſt fit that God alone ſhould appoint the duties of his own ſervice. The truth is, in matters of practiſe, mans authority hath to doe only in two things: Firſt, in applying the rules of morall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to particulars, for the preſervation of order, and peace thereby. Secondly, in compelling men to obedience, in ſuch duties as are preſcribed. In brief then, divine Authority eſtabliſheth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of faith, and preſcribes the ſubſtance of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108952:41"/>dutie; humane authority, meddles not in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down any grounds of faith at all, and in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall duties preſcribes, not the ſubſtance, but onely the order and manner of outward performance of that which divine authority hath commanded.</p>
                     <p>The third difference between divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority,
<note place="margin">3. In the extent of this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which bindes the conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, belonging onely to God.</note> is in the extent of them both. Humane authority (being ordained for preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of order, and by it of peace, in civill ſociety, for the furtherance and ſupporting of godlineſſe and honeſty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2.) reacheth no farther then to binde men to conform to order in the courſe of their practiſe; but divine Authority having an higher ſcope, even the renuing of the heart, and bringing under the thoughts thereof to the obedience of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. bindes the conſcience, that is, both the judgement of man, to allow that which is commanded, as holy and juſt, with the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. and the will to chooſe it as good, and the affections to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. accordingly: yea, the whole man to follow it, with the ſtrength of conſtant endeavours, after the Prophet <hi>Davids</hi> example, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.106.112.</p>
                     <p>Hence it follows, that in obeying mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, he that doth what Authority re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires (ſo he perform it in a willing ſubmiſſion thereunto, in obedience to God, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle cals obeying for conſcience ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5.) hath performed his duty, neither hath cauſe to judge himſelf a tranſgreſſour, though he approve not the law it ſelf as good and holy, nay, though
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108952:41"/>upon good ground he think the contrary to that which is commanded, more fit and convenient, ſo he think not ſo out of any ſelf-conceipt, raſh judgement, or diſtaſte of the Authority that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. But in obeying Gods Commandements it is far otherwiſe. For though a man fulfill the law in the outward act, yet if he allow it not as holy and juſt, if his endeavour be not to conform his will to Gods will therein, if he rejoyce not in performing it as a good man doth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.15. his own conſcience ought to condemn him as a tranſgreſſour, and ſinner againſt God, at leaſt in ſome degree. So then divine Authority bindes the conſcience by a double band, both of the power that commands, and of the juſtice of the commandement; but humane Authority bindes onely by vertue of the power that commands, not by the equity of the commandement, further then it agrees with Gods law, or conduceth to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and peace, for which Authority was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
                     <p>The laſt difference between divine and humane Authority,
<note place="margin">4. In the ſanctions annexed to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</note> is in reſpect of the ſanctions annexed to their laws, which are proportioned to the nature and quality of the obedience required, and to the power of him that requires it. For Gods commands in his laws are ſpecially inward holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, righteouſneſſe, love, &amp;c. and that under the penalty of the curſe, and wrath of God,
<note place="margin">1. Reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſoul. 2. And reaching to eternity.</note> to bee poured out on the ſoul, as well as on the body, both in this life, &amp; in the everlaſting flames of hel fire, if men ſin againſt the law, and under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108952:42"/>of eternall life if they fulfill it. Whereas men, that require an orderly converſation out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, threaten and promiſe onely ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and temporary good or evill.</p>
                     <p>Theſe differences between divine and humane Authority, laid together, may help us to a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them ſeverally,
<note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of divine Authority,</note> by which their natures are beſt diſtinguiſhed. Divine Authority is that power of God, founded upon the totall depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of all creatures upon him, and upon his infallible wiſdome, truth and goodneſſe, by which hee hath right to preſcribe and manifeſt all grounds of truth to be beleeved, and aſſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to upon his own teſtimony, without contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to give rules of practiſe, to be embraced with all the heart, as perfectly holy, juſt and good, becauſe he commands them, under the rewards and penalties of everlaſting life, and eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>Humane Authority,
<note place="margin">And hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</note> is a limited power, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from God to man, by which he is warranted, according to Gods will, for the furthering of publique good, to preſcribe unto ſuch as are put under his power, rules of order in their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for preſerving peace in a way of godlineſſe and honeſty, binding thoſe whom they command in all things, not contrary to Gods law, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their practiſe and actions thereunto, for the Authority which commands them in Gods name, under the rewards and penalties of ſome outward good or evill.</p>
                     <p>By this which hath been delivered, concerning
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108952:42"/>the grounds and extent of that divine Authority, which we challenge and claim to be due to the Scriptures, we may obſerve what power this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Word ought to have over mens hearts, and conſequently in what manner it ought to bee heard, read, and received. Whatſoever it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, the heart muſt aſſent unto and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, without contradiction or debate, how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable or improbable ſoever it appear to carnall reaſon. And whatſoever is commanded therein, the whole heart and every thought of it muſt ſtoop unto, and embrace, as holy and good, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it pleaſe or diſpleaſe the naturall man, and that meerly for the Authority of him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it.</p>

                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. And by this means ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is won to their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</note> the corrupt nature of men is ſuch, as we know that the leaſt occaſion would be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to breed diſtaſte of that, which nature in it ſelf is ſo averſe from, (as the dreſſing, veſſell, or ſometimes ſervitor, that preſents the ſick man the meat which his ſtomack loaths, moves him to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor it) and conſequently, if there were juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt the perſons that bring it, the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage it ſelf would quickly be diſtaſted, as the Lords
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108952:43"/>offerings were for <hi>Elies</hi> wicked ſons, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17. So that it concerned the Lord, both for his owne honour, and his Churches good, to deliver his Word by the hands of holy men.</p>
                     <p>It addes ſomething to the eſtimation of the Scriptures, that they were written by ſuch holy men, as we have formerly mentioned, but this at the uttermoſt addes unto them onely an humane reſpect,
<note place="margin">2.

The Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, 21. deſcribes that kinde of aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, in the delivery of the Scriptures, two ways. <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by way of negation, that they were neither of private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, nor came by the wil of man.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                        <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> he deſcribes the ſame aſſiſtance affirmatively, teſtifying that they ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>In the former of theſe,
<note place="margin">Not by the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of nature.</note> wherein he expreſſeth this manner of delivering the Scriptures by way of negation, the Apoſtle excludes the working of the naturall faculties of mans minde altogether: <hi>Firſt,</hi> the underſtanding,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> when he denies that the Scripture is of any private interpretation, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mens own explication, that is, it was not expreſſed by the underſtanding of man, or delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to mans judgement, or by his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108952:44"/>So that not onely the matter or ſubſtance of the truths revealed,
<note place="margin">Both in the matter and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> but the very forms of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion were not of mans deviſing, as they are in Preaching, where the matter which men preach is not, or ought not to be the Miniſters own that preacheth, but is the Word of truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. but the tearms, phraſes, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are his own.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> he ſaith, that it came not by the will of man, who neither made his own choice of the matters to be handled,
<note place="margin">Neither of them ſuggeſted by mans underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, nor directed by his wil; farther then to underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; approve what the Spirit ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted. But the Pen-men were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the holy Ghoſt.</note> nor of the forms and manner of delivery: So that both the underſtanding, and will of man, as farre as they were meerly naturall, had nothing to doe in this holy work, ſave onely to underſtand, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that which was dictated by God himſelfe, unto thoſe that wrote it from his mouth, or the ſuggeſting of his Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Again, the work of the holy Ghoſt in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the Scriptures is ſet down affirmatively, when the Pen-men of thoſe ſacred writings are deſcribed, to ſpeak as they were moved or carried by the holy Ghoſt, a phraſe which muſt be wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood. For we may not conceive that they were moved in writing theſe Scriptures, as the pen is moved by the hand that guides it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding what they did: For they not onely underſtood, but willingly conſented to what they wrote, and were not like thoſe that pronounced the Devils Oracles, rapt and carried out of themſelves by a kinde of extaſie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Devill made uſe of their tongues and mouths, to pronounce that which themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108952:44"/>not. But the Apoſtles meaning is, that the Spirit of God moved them in this work of writing the Scriptures, not according to nature,
<note place="margin">Yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly &amp; willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> but above nature, ſhining into their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings clearly, and fully, by an heavenly and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall light, and carrying and moving their wils thereby with a delight, and holy embracing of that truth revealed, and with a like deſire to publiſh and make known the ſecrets and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of God, revealed unto them, unto his Church.</p>
                     <p>Yea, beyond all this, the holy Ghoſt not only ſuggeſted unto them the ſubſtance of that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which they were to deliver and leave upon record unto the Church, (for ſo far he uſually aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts faithfull Miniſters, in diſpenſing of the Word, in the courſe of their Miniſtery) but beſides hee ſupplyed unto them the very phraſes, method,
<note place="margin">The holy Ghoſt made choice both of the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and methods.</note> and whole order of thoſe things that are written in the Scriptures, whereas he leaves Miniſters in preaching the Word, to the choice of their own phraſes and expreſſions, wherein, as alſo in ſome particulars which they deliver, they may be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, although in the main fundamentals which they lay before their hearers, and in the generall courſe of the work of their Miniſtery, they do not groſly erre. Thus then the holy Ghoſt, not only aſſiſted holy men in penning the Scriptures, but in a ſort took the work out of their hand, making uſe of nothing in the men, but of their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to receive and comprehend, their wils to conſent unto, and their hands to write downe that which they delivered.</p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:108952:45"/>
                     <p>When we ſay, that the holy Ghoſt framed the very phraſe and ſtyle wherein the Scriptures were written, we mean not, that he altered the phraſe and manner of ſpeaking, wherewith cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and education had acquainted thoſe that wrote the Scriptures,
<note place="margin">Yet utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as it were in the ſound of their voice</note> but rather ſpeaks his own words, as it were in the ſound of their voice, or chooſeth out of their words and phraſes ſuch as were fit for his own purpoſe. Thus upon inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments men play what leſſon they pleaſe, but the inſtrument renders the ſound of it more harſh or pleaſant, according to the nature of it ſelf. Thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Pen-men of Scriptures, we finde that ſome write in a rude and more impoliſhed ſtyle, as <hi>Amos;</hi> ſome in a more elegant phraſe, as <hi>Iſay.</hi> Some diſcover art and learning in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as S. <hi>Paul;</hi> others write in a more vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar way, as S. <hi>James.</hi> And yet withall the Spirit of God drew their naturall ſtyle to an higher pirch, in divine expreſſions, fitted to the ſubject in hand.</p>
                     <p>How needfull it was, that the Spirit of God ſhould ſolely manage and accompliſh this work of penning the Scriptures, hath been ſhewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the former point, wherein we proved that the Scriptures muſt neceſſarily be the Word of God, ſeeing faith can ſtay it ſelf on no other foundation, then a divine teſtimony, and our ſervices cannot be accompted a duty of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, unleſſe it be done in obedience to Gods will, which can be made known no other way then by his own Word. Now the inferences hold
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108952:45"/>ſtrongly thus, The Scriptures are Gods own Word, therefore they muſt be delivered by his owne Spirit, ſeeing none elſe could know Gods minde, as none knows the minde of man but the ſpirit which is in man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11.</p>

                     <p>When we ſay, it is onely the will of God, that makes faith and obedience neceſſary to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108952:46"/>ſalvation, we deny not but this will of his hath in this, as in all things elſe, reſpect to his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<note place="margin">For the advancing of his own glory. 1. Our faith bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to his Al-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, &amp; Truth. 2. Our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, &amp; Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Yet are not all things in Scripture alike ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</note> which is teſtified at leaſt by our faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. For our relying on him by faith bears witneſſe to his ſufficiency, faithfulneſſe, &amp; truth, as our obedience in ſubmitting chearfully to his will, in all that he commands, acknowledgeth his Authority, Wiſdome, and Holineſſe; So then this will of God, in requiring of us theſe conditions, is every way juſt as well as free. Now when wee ſay, the grounds and rules of faith and obedience, contained in Scripture, are neceſſary to ſalvation, we mean not that all are of like neceſſity. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or unbeleef in God, or Chriſt, excludes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely from ſalvation, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. ſo doth not ignorance, or unbeleef in ſome temporall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, although it cannot be excuſed from ſinne. In brief then, when we ſay all things neceſſary to ſalvation are contained in Scripture, we mean both that the things written therein are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that end, although not alike neceſſary, and that there is nothing neceſſary to that end, that is not to be found there.</p>
                     <p>We are next to ſhew what we underſtand by this tearm <hi>containing.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Scriptures containe things, 1. In ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe tearms. 2. By ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</note> Now things may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, either expreſly, and in plain tearms, or by conſequence drawn from ſome grounds that are delivered in Scripture, and one of theſe two ways all grounds of faith, or rules of practiſe, are to be found in theſe holy writings. It is no where affirmed in Scripture in expreſſe tearms, that the holy Ghoſt is God, but we read,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108952:47"/>1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. that the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghoſt are one, and from thence infer by neceſſary conſequence, that the holy Ghoſt is God, becauſe he is one with the Father, who is God. We are no where in preciſe words com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to baptize infants, but from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept given to the Fathers to circumciſe them, we take our ſelves to be warranted to baptize them, becauſe Baptiſme and Circumciſion are in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance one Sacrament. Wee are no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly commanded to diſcover the fault of what we ſell, or to give a juſt value for that which we buy. But we have generall rules commanding us to ſpeak the truth from the heart, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 15.2. To doe as we deſire to be done unto, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12. and forbidden to defraud our brother in any matter, or goe beyond him in bargaining, which imports as much. Thus, where all things needfull to be beleeved, or done, are not clearly expreſſed in Scripture, yet they are implied and drawn out from thence by neceſſary conſequence.</p>
                     <p>This truth, that the Scriptures contain what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is neceſſary to ſalvation, is ſufficiently ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, by evident teſtimony of the Word it ſelf, which ſends us to the Law, and to the Teſtimony, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. tels us, that in them we have eternall life, <hi>John</hi> 5.39. that they alone are able to make the man of God perfect to every good work, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17. and wiſe to ſalvation, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. that the Law of God is perfect, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. and though there be an end of all other perfections, yet the commandement is exceeding broad, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.96.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108952:47"/>that is, comprehends all needfull things, ſo that nothing is wanting in it. Whence proceeds that curſe upon every one that addes, as well as upon them that take away from that Book, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. Yea beſides, this truth is conſonant to all grounds of reaſon, whatſoever our adverſaries alledge to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, we have reaſon to preſume,
<note place="margin">It was fit that God ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his will in writing. 1. As the moſt eaſie way to make it publike.</note> that God would take the eaſieſt way for the inſtruction of his Church; now it is evident, that it is more eaſie to leave things upon record in writing, then to charge them upon mens memories, eſpecially when they are many, and conſequently muſt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the memory; whereas lying before mens eyes, in writing, they may eaſily be overlooked at all times, without trouble. If it be replied that traditions are few, and may therefore be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remembred: VVe anſwer <hi>firſt;</hi> they may bee infinite, for ought we know, ſeeing no man ever took upon him to tell us how many they are. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> be they more or fewer, yet they are more eaſily preſerved by writing, then by tradition, as all men know.</p>
                     <p>Again, it was fit that in teaching his Church,
<note place="margin">2. As the ſafeſt way to prevent corruption</note> God ſhould take the ſafeſt way, and freeſt from errour, as well for his own honour, as for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples good, both which muſt needs be extreamly hazarded and hindered by corrupting the truth with errours, which lead men into perdition, and can hardly be prevented by delivering the word by tradition, partly, becauſe many mens memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are weak, and a great part are negligent, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108952:48"/>in things of this nature; and laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many are maliciouſly bent againſt the law, which the wiſdome of the fleſh cannot admit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. whereas the word written, being an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring record, eaſily helps the weak, and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the refractary, by ſetting the undoubted truth before mens eyes.</p>
                     <p>Farther,
<note place="margin">3. As the beſt way to win credit to his Word.</note> ſeeing the word is the ground of faith, it is fit that it ſhould be ſo delivered as might win moſt credit and eſtimation amongſt men. Now we know that written records are moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall, and of moſt accompt with men, and therefore are fitteſt to work men to aſſent unto the truth of God. It is true I grant, that mens faith depends neither upon wirting nor tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but upon the teſtimony of the Spirit that dwels within the godlies hearts, manifeſting that the truth propoſed is the word of God. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the outward credit which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures carry amongſt men, by which ſuch as are won afterwards to beleeve, beginne at firſt to think reverently of them; and others that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved not, are reſtrained from ſcorning or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them, ſeems to be much furthered by the Authority that the writing brings unto thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, which are received and ſubmitted unto by the Church, and commanded and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by the teſtimony thereof.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">4. And as moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.</note> whereas there is ſo much honour done to all humane laws, by which States are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they are compoſed into one body, and preſerved in books written or printed for that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:108952:48"/>purpoſe, it ſeems abſurd that God ſhould deliver his law thus by patches, part by writing, and part by tradition, reſembling the feet of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars</hi> image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.33. part of iron, and part of clay, and unworthy both of the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of him that gives the law, and of the law it ſelf that is given. And if we may take prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from former times, we may ſay with our Saviour, from the beginning it was not ſo. For when God left the law to be delivered by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he delivered it wholly, that way; when he cauſed it to be written, he cauſed it to bee written wholly, not only the Morall, but the Judiciall and Ceremoniall too, containing many obſervances of ſmall value, tearmed beggerly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9. So that he left not out the leaſt circumſtance of any legall rites to be ſupplyed by tradition. Is now Chriſt leſſe faithfull in Gods houſe, then <hi>Moſes</hi> was? Or how is it that in this clear light of the Goſpel, we ſhould be left more uncertain, then the Jews were under the law? and that in matters of greateſt importance, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, the Popes Supremacy, Invocation of Saints, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, when men put no ſtint to their traditions, nor give us any accompt of the number of them, they give cauſe of ſuſpition, that they have purpoſely left open this back door, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh into the Church thoſe humane inventions of theirs, under the cloake of the Traditions of the Church, which otherwiſe the expreſſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the written word had excluded. But we
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108952:49"/>reſolve to forbear controverſies: Onely, to quicken men to a more heedfull attention to the Scriptures, it was needfull to ſhew, not only that the moſt weighty things, that concern us far more neerly then our Lands and Revenues, then our libertie or lives, even our evidences for, and directions to everlaſting bleſſedneſſe, are to be found in the Scriptures, but more then that, to make it appear that they are to bee found in no other books or writings. Whence it muſt needs follow, that without this word ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither firm ground to ſtay our faith on, nor any certain rule to guide our practiſe by, we are in this left without light, without comfort for the preſent, and without hope or expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for time to come.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:108952:50"/>confeſſe that they all praiſe him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.10.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that theſe works and ways of God,
<note place="margin">Theſe works of God are not clearly diſcovered but by the light of the Word.</note> without the light of the word, doe ſet forth the glory of him that made them, as a curious piece of work ſhews the skill of him that formed it. But to a blinde man, who hath no eyes, and to him, who having eyes wants light to diſcover the form of it, neither the exactneſſe of the work it ſelf, nor the skill of him that made it appear. Whereas therefore men in themſelves, are as it were in the twilight, when they bring their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reaſon to judge of Gods ways and works; the word of God ſets them out in a clearer light, by diſcovering unto men, not onely the workes themſelves, but withall the rules according to which they are wrought, and end at which they aim, as that the wicked are raiſed up aloft, that they may be caſt down into deſtruction, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 73.18. and flouriſh, that they may be deſtroyed for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.7. a conſideration that clears Gods juſtice in this particular, and thereby much advanceth his honour.</p>
                     <p>To advance the honour of God yet farther,
<note place="margin">4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the weakneſſe of the creature.</note> the Scriptures diſcover unto us the weakneſſe and inſufficiency of the creatures, that the all-ſufficiency of God may be more admired, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12, 13. <hi>&amp; Pſalm</hi> 146.3, 4, 6. manifeſting that they were nothing at the firſt, have nothing now, but what is borrowed from God, and that too in a very ſcant proportion. So that if we enquire where wiſdome, power, ſufficiency and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are to be found, the depth ſaith, it is not in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108952:51"/>me, the ſea anſwers, it is not in me, all creatures they have heard the fame thereof, <hi>Job</hi> 28.22. but onely the mighty Creator of heaven and earth, hath poſſeſſed all theſe things, in the beginning of his ways. Thus the Word ſets out riches, mens ſtrong City, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.11. to be nothing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. ſtrong wals, no better then ripe figges that fall into the eaters mouth, <hi>Nah.</hi> 3.12. hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and chariots, a broken reed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.8. unable to ſave a man, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 33.17. honour an empty breath, gracing no man without wiſdome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.20. men lighter then vanity, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 62.9.

                     <p>Thus the Scriptures, ſetting God and the creatures one againſt another, like a foil under a diamond, God in his abſolute and tranſcendent perfections, the creatures, though excellent by the beauty that God hath given them, yet empty, weak, and contemptible, compared with God, doe advance his glory beyond compariſon. So that as the height of heaven is ſeen by this, that when wee have climed the top of ſome high mountain, which, when we ſtood in the low val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, ſeemed to touch the skye, we find our ſelves to be as far from heaven, as we were before: So when we have beheld the greateſt excellencies of the moſt admired creatures, it is no more in compariſon of Gods perfections, then if we had ſeen the baſeſt worm. By theſe divers ways doe the Scriptures advance Gods honour, and throw
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108952:51"/>down all creatures at his foot.</p>

Next, the Scriptures propoſe the rules of an holy life, being the way that leads to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo ſerve for a guide to direct us, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.105.

                     <p>The next means by which the Scriptures further our ſalvation,
<note place="margin">2.

Withall, it cauſeth us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Gods Gommandements, which we finde ſweeter then honey to our mouths, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.103. or at leaſt provokes us to a longing deſire after them; as <hi>David</hi> opened his mouth and panted, longing for them, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.131. wiſhing that his ways were directed to keep Gods ſtatutes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.5. craving Gods help to aſſiſt us therein, to

<note place="margin">A ſpring or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note> as <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.14. yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a laſting ſupply of grace, as a fountain doth of water: ſometimes from the Authour from whom it is derived,

                        <p>What name ſoever we give it, we may not conceive it to be a new faculty, added unto thoſe which are in men by nature. A man when he is regenerate, hath no more faculties in his ſoul, then he had before he was regenerate.
<note place="margin">Which is no faculty added to thoſe which are naturall. But a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty altered,</note> Only in the work of regeneration, thoſe abilities which the man had before are improved, and receive a farther ſtrength to comprehend, and work ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, as they did naturally before regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus our bodies in the reſurrection from the dead, ſhall have no more, nor other parts then they have at preſent, onely thoſe which are now naturall, ſhall then be made by the power of God ſpirituall, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44.</p>

                        <p>But a more lively reſemblance of this change in the faculties of the ſoul,
<note place="margin">And brought under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Spirit;</note> in this work of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, we may diſcern in thoſe naturall and ſenſitive faculties, which we have common with beaſts; For they having no higher principle then ſenſe, uſe them ſenſually, but a man, enjoying the ſame faculties, under the command of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoul, uſeth them rationally. So happens it in a regenerate man, his underſtanding, will, and affections, which when they had no other command but reaſon, had no more but rationall operations, now being under the guiding of the Spirit of Chriſt, ruling in him, work ſpiritually. Hence it is, that a regenerate man every where in Scripture is ſaid to walk after the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. to be led by the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.18. to walk in the Spirit, <hi>ver.</hi> 25.</p>
                        <p>This principle of ſpirituall life,
<note place="margin">Which is the root of ſpiritual habits im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ſo called.</note> planted in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate perſon, by his union with Chriſt, is the fountain or root of all thoſe habits of ſpirituall grace, which are ſeverally diſtinguiſhed by the names of faith, hope, love, fear, &amp;c. although to ſpeak properly,
<note place="margin">Properly onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the actings of that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</note> they are but the diverſifications of the actings of that ſpirituall principle within us, diſtinguiſhed by theſe names, which withall, after the manner of naturall habits, are much encreaſed, and ſtrengthned by the uſe and much exerciſe of them, and are as much weakned by diſuſe and neglect of exerciſe. Out of that which hitherto hath been ſpoken, we may ſee, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man hath in him theſe three things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> a principle of ſpirituall life. <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſpirituall
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108952:55"/>habits of faith, hope, love, fear, &amp;c. which flow or ſpring from that principle. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> ſpirituall motions and operations according to thoſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.</p>
                        <p>The manner of giving or planting this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all principle in a regenerate man,
<note place="margin">4. Given by way of infuſing or ſhedding.</note> we expreſſe by the tearm of endowing; now that wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all working or endeavours of men in gaining it, as indeed it muſt be acknowledged to be Gods gift, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.10. In a more ſtrict ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation it is called infuſing, or pouring in, or out, as that phraſe is applyed, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.28. and <hi>Acts</hi> 2.35. to expreſſe the large and plentifull beſtowing of the gift of tongues, as it is in other places to ſignifie the like manner of giving other ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all graces, which the Apoſtle affirms God ſhed on us abundantly through Chriſt, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6.</p>
                        <p>This phraſe of infuſing or ſhedding (as hath already been intimated) implies men to be meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſive,
<note place="margin">Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting man to bee meerely paſſive in receiving it.</note> in receiving this ſpirituall life, yet not altogether as veſſels are in receiving that which is poured into them. To make this more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the holy Ghoſt ſets out that ſtate, in which grace finds us, being yet unregenerate, by the name of death, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1.5. as it doth our rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration by the name of quickning, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. and 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.18. new birth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3.5. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. creating, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. whence regenerate men are tearmed new creatures, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. All phraſes which imply us to be as meerly paſſive in the act of our renovation, as we were in our firſt creation or generation.</p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:108952:55"/>
                        <p>Indeed if your New birth, were no more, but the improving of ſomething which we had in us before, or the ſtrengthning only of that which was weake in us, it is true that man himſelfe might cooperate with the Spirit of Chriſt in this worke. But ſeeing it appeares to be the beſtowing of that which was not at all; what is there, in the man to be regenerate, that can cooperate with the Spirit, in his Regeneration? Nature can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, unleſſe it be to hinder and oppoſe the worke. For we know that is enmity againſt God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. and cannot receive the things of God: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. At the beſt we know nature is but the matter which is renewed, or new formed; and matter, as we all know, can have no operation at all. As for grace or ſpirituall life, we know we had none at all, till it was infuſed, and that which is not at all, cannot poſſibly have any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration. So that it muſt needes bee granted that there is nothing in a man to be regenerate, that can worke any thing at all in the act of his regeneration.</p>
                        <p>It being granted then that a man is meerely <hi>paſſive</hi> in the worke of his regeneration,
<note place="margin">And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us how it is wrought. Though we may diſcerne 1 the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations thereunto:</note> it muſt needs be impoſſible for him to diſcover how it is wrought, as impoſſible as it is for one to know how he receives his owne life. It is true that he may diſcerne the preparations to the worke, ſuch as are thoſe terrours and agonies which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are before the worke of regeneration, and are raiſed in a mans heart, by the diſcovery of his owne miſerable condition, in which he ſtands,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108952:56"/>and of the unability of all the creatures in the world to bring him any helpe, ſeconded with ſome ſerious deliberations what to doe, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſome deſires and purpoſes to make uſe of ſome meanes for the eſcaping of Gods wrath, if it may be. Such motions as theſe are, by which the heart is many times prepared for the worke of regeneration (which may be reſembled to the heating of metalls before they melt, and are caſt into the molde to be faſhioned) becauſe in them the ſpirit of a man is wrought upon in a naturall way, and by the helpe of naturall reaſon one may diſcerne, as any creature that makes uſe of ſenſe and motion, cannot chooſe but diſcerne and know what it ſelfe doth.</p>
                        <p>Much more may a perſon regenerate,
<note place="margin">2. and firſt operations thereof.</note> diſcerne and underſtand the motions and operations, that are performed by him, after he is regenerate, ſeeing it is evident that in them his ſpirit workes together with the Spirit of Chriſt. Onely the firſt act of infuſing and receiving grace, being wrought <hi>in</hi> us, and not <hi>by</hi> us, yea and that in an inſtant, and not by degrees, is impoſſible to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, how it is wrought, either by nature, which underſtands not ſpirituall things, or by ſpirituall ſenſe, which (as we have ſeene already) flowes from that ſpirituall life newly received, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot diſcerne what was done before it had any beeing at all.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding, it is not impoſſible for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man to feele the very firſt illapſe of the Spirit into the ſoule, for it may bring that ſenſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108952:56"/>with it ſelfe, although it doth not alwayes ſo,
<note place="margin">Yet it may bring the ſenſe of it ſelfe even in the inſtant of receiving it, but not uſually.</note> nor perhaps uſually; for though when a blinde man receives ſight, he muſt needes know that he ſees, as ſoone as he ſees, yet in receiving this ſpirituall life it is not ſo. The giving of ſpirituall life, and the giving of the ſenſe of it, be two diſtinct acts of the Spirit, which may, but doe not alwayes, goe together. Howſoever even in ſuch perſons as in the inſtant of regeneration feele themſelves regenerate, though they know what is wrought in them, yet how it is wrought they cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
                        <p>The author of this worke of regeneration is Chriſt by the Spirit. Unto this,
<note place="margin">By the Spirit of Chriſt.</note> the faſhioning and quickning of all things that are created, and continually renewed, is aſcribed, as in the firſt Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2. the Spirit is ſaid to move up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the waters, that is, to faſhion and form that rude maſſe out of which all things were made, that Spirit garniſhed the Heavens, <hi>Job</hi> 26.13.

And in the Sacraments, the elements and the Sacramentall actions, by which they are uſed and applied, we know are naturall, but thoſe things that are repreſented by them, are wholly Myſticall and Spirituall: in both, the naturall man underſtands the phraſes, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and rationall diſcourſe in the Word, and in the Sacraments, not only the viſible Elements and actions, but their ſignification alſo; but the things ſignified in both, ſeeing they are ſuch as eye hath not ſeene, and that cannot be comprehended by any Naturall meanes, they cannot be underſtood by any naturall man.</p>
                        <p>All the difficulty in unfolding this truth lyes in interpreting this terme Spiritually,
<note place="margin">4. Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</note> a word that may be taken in a double ſenſe, as is alſo the word Spirit whence it is derived. For a ſpirit in ſtrict ſignification, is that which is abſolutely and meerely ſo, and in that ſenſe the name is appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to God alone, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.24. According to this ſenſe, Spirituall is that, which is of or belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, or heavenly and ſpirituall. Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively a Spirit ſignifies that which is leſſe groſſe, or materiall, to which is oppoſed groſſe, carnall
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108952:58"/>and ſenſuall: both ſenſes may be included under this terme, in this place.</p>
                        <p>Againe to comprehend ſpiritually may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: <hi>Firſt,</hi> to the object comprehended,
<note place="margin">Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the object imports 1. to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that in things which is ſpirituall. Or by a Spirituall Light to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all things.</note> and ſo it ſignifies to comprehend that which is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in that object: <hi>Secondly,</hi> it may be referred to the meanes, and it ſignifies to comprehend things by a ſpirituall light or judgement. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> referred to the manner, it implies to comprehend in a Supernaturall way, which we ſpecially intend in this place, though withall we include both the former ſenſes.</p>
                        <p>What it is to comprehend, or underſtand things ſpiritually is hard to expreſſe, as it is hard to deſcribe, what it is to ſee or heare, which are well knowne to ſuch as ſee, or heare, but is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be deſcribed ſo diſtinctly by diſcourſe.
<note place="margin">Reſembled by ſight, to which faith anſwers;</note> The Scripture ſets it out by reſemblance of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. and amongſt the ſenſes ſets out the two wayes of diſcovering things ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, faith by ſight, and experience by taſte.

                        <p>FAith or beleeving is in common uſe of ſpeech taken for inclining ſtrongly in opinion unto that of which we have no infallible aſſurance,
<note place="margin">Faith not taken here as oppoſed to certaine knowledge:</note> and in that ſenſe it is oppoſed to knowledge, which ſignifies aſſurance of ſome thing upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
<note place="margin">Butimport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain knowledge upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> and that moſt commonly by ſome ſenſe or other. But amongſt Divines, Faith is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken for a full perſwaſion of any truth upon Divine Teſtimony. This Faith is uſually diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed into Hiſtoricall, Temporary, and Juſtifying Faith, (as for that which they tearme the faith of Miracles, it concernes not the ſubject that we have in hand.) But becauſe Temporary faith, will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after appear to differ not in nature, but onely in ſome degree from Hiſtoricall faith, we ſhall need onely to entreat of that and Juſtifying faith, at preſent.</p>
                        <p>The nature of true faith, and the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that, and the other, which we call Hiſtorical, will be moſt eaſily &amp; clearly diſcovered, by ſetting downe a briefe deſcription thereof,
<note place="margin">True or juſtifying Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the ſeverall parts of it afterwards. We therefore define faith, to be a ſpirituall habite, by which a Regenerate man having in himſelfe, upon a Divine teſtimony, an evidence of the truth, and goodneſſe of the Promiſe, and Covenant of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:108952:59"/>eternall Salvation through Jeſus Chriſt, relies on him onely for everlaſting life, and bleſſednes.</p>
                        <p>We call Faith an habit,
<note place="margin">Which is, 1. An Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like it. 1. Seeing it is infuſed, not gotten by uſe. 2. And can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits may, be wholy loſt.</note> becauſe it much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles thoſe habits which are properly ſo called, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in this, that it is hardly, or (according to truth) never to be removed or wholly loſt: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though otherwiſe it differ from them in this, that thoſe naturall habits are acquired by uſe, whereas faith is infuſed by the Spirit of grace, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the firſt planting of it in the heart: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it cannot be denied, that when it is once rooted in the heart, it may be and is further ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, and perfected by continuall uſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe as our naturall habits are.</p>
                        <p>The cauſe of faith is (as hath beene already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated) the Spirit of Grace flowing unto a regenerate man from Chriſt his head,
<note place="margin">2. Infuſed by the ſpirit abiding in us,</note> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that cauſe as well as of the nature of it, we tearme it a ſpirituall habit, and ſo we finde it reckoned amongſt the fruits or effects of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. And here we meet with the firſt difference betweene Hiſtoricall, and Juſtifying Faith, that they proceed from different cauſes, the one being infuſed by the ſpirit of Chriſt, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in us, the other the effect onely of naturall reaſon, further inlightned (at the moſt) by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of that Spirit, as ſhall be farther proved hereafter.</p>
                        <p>The ſubject of juſtifying Faith,
<note place="margin">3. Into a regenerate perſon.</note> is onely a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate perſon. For, whoſoever beleeves hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.24. into which there can be no entrance without regeneration, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.5. but in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108952:60"/>more expreſſe tearmes, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.1. the Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, that whoſoever beleeves that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is borne of God. Now hiſtoricall faith we know may be found in the Devills themſelves, <hi>Iames</hi> 2.19. And temporary faith, (which as we have intimated already, is of the ſame nature) may be in ſuch as have no root, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. that is, as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it in another phraſe, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.9. No ſeed of God abiding in him, nor is borne of God, which is all one. And from hence ariſeth the ſecond difference betweene hiſtoricall, and juſtifying Faith, that they are found in divers ſubjects, the firſt even in the wicked, the latter onely in the godly.</p>
                        <p>The kind of aſſurance which true faith is built upon,
<note place="margin">4. Which gives him an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</note> we call an evidence, as the Apoſtle alſo tearmes it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. Who alſo in the ſame place expreſſeth the object of that faith, by two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent names given it, in divers reſpects, Things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, and Things not ſeene: as alſo he expreſſeth the aſſurance of them, by two other names, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and Evidence. Now it is true that by thoſe different names, the ſame things are meant, for the moſt part, although it be true, that ſome of thoſe things which we beleeve, although they be inviſible, have notwithſtanding a beeing in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and therefore cannot properly be ſaid to be expreſſed by hope, ſo that the things hoped for, are but ſome of thoſe things which we beleeve.</p>
                        <p>Theſe objects,
<note place="margin">Of things inviſible,</note> Things inviſible, and Things hoped for, (and conſequently yet to come) Faith ſo apprehends, as having withall a kinde of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108952:60"/>and viſibility, although in divers reſpects. For looking at things which it beleeves, it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends them, as already having a being in the will and purpoſe of God, and this it doth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out errour, as God without errour calls the things which are not, as if they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. ſeeing they have a beeing in him, although they have no ſubſiſtence as yet in themſelves. Theſe and other objects which are not ſeen, Faith makes evident, that is, beholds them by a ſpirituall ſenſe though they be hidden from the bodily eye, as <hi>Abraham</hi> in this manner is ſaid to behold Chriſts day, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.56. which was not in beeing till many hundred yeares after, and <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to ſee him that is inviſible. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. And thus is faith, the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and evidence of things that are not ſeene.</p>
                        <p>When we ſay that by faith we have a ſpirituall evidence,
<note place="margin">And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore makes no uſe of ſenſe, or reaſon.</note> and manifeſtation of things that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible to the outward ſenſe, we neceſſarily imply that this Faith makes not uſe in this apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any naturall help, either of Senſe or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Not of Senſe, for things inviſible cannot be the object of ſenſe. Nor of Reaſon, which can help in this caſe little more then Senſe; ſeeing it receives information by Senſe, from whence it gathers things by way of diſcourſe, which indeed may convince a man that things are, but can give him no evidence, or Demonſtration of the things themſelves.</p>
                        <p>Hence it is, that when a man comprehends things by Reaſon, he may be able by diſcourſe of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108952:61"/>Reaſon to inform another man of that which he knowes, and by that meanes cauſe him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it as well as himſelfe; but in thoſe things which are apprehended by Senſe,
<note place="margin">But appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the things themſelves by ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſenſe:</note> he cannot doe ſo. He can relate to another man what he ſeeth, or heareth, or taſteth, but can neither make him ſee, nor heare, nor taſte, that which himſelfe doth, nor (if he be one that never had uſe of thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) make him by any diſcourſe underſtand, either what the object is that he apprehends,
<note place="margin">And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what he feeles.</note> or how his ſenſe is affected by it, or (if he have the uſe of the ſame ſenſes) make him able by his diſcourſe, to apprehend the thing it ſelfe, which he diſcernes in its proper ſpecies, though he may breed in him ſome conceit of it by an imagination of ſome other thing of the ſame kinde, which that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon himſelfe hath apprehended by the ſame ſenſe before. So is it in matters of faith, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves cannot many times give a reaſon why he beleeves, nor at any time repreſent unto another that which is manifeſted unto him, nor ſhew him what ſatisfying delight, and ſweetneſſe he findes in thoſe things which he beleeves: he can onely in generall manifeſt unto him that he findes the tender mercies of God exceeding great, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.156. his thoughts towards us precious, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.17. his Teſtimonies wonderfull, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.129. and exceeding ſweet, <hi>ver.</hi> 103. but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſcribe that excellency, or ſweetneſſe, which himſelfe finds. Yet ſeeing thoſe things that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, are alſo agreeable to right reaſon, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonablenes of them the beleever may manifeſt to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108952:61"/>another, but the evidence of them he cannot ſhew.
<note place="margin">This evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by demonſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall faith wants:</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>How juſtifying faith hath an evidence of the things which it apprehends, we have ſeene: Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall wants this evidence, as we ſhall ſee anon, as having no further aſſurance of what it beleeves, then that which Reaſon ſuggeſts, which may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be tearmed a conviction that ſuch things muſt be, then an evidence what they be.
<note place="margin">And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore differs, from juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, not onely in degrees but in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, is built upon a divine Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</note> Whence it is evident, that thoſe two kinds of faith are of different natures, not onely of divers degrees, becauſe the grounds of aſſurance on which they are built, are as farre different, as Reaſon, and Senſe.</p>
                        <p>To cleare this truth fully, we muſt conſider the different teſtimonies, upon which juſtifying and hiſtoricall faith are built. For we ſhall find that true faith is built upon a Divine, the other upon an Humane teſtimony, which our Saviour calls the Revelation of fleſh and blood, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. as the Apoſtle doth the other, The Demonſtration of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. and a little after, The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of things by the Spirit, which are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood onely of ſpirituall men: <hi>ver.</hi> 10.14, 15.</p>
                        <p>We call that a Divine teſtimony which is given by the Spirit of God to that ſpirit which is within a regenerate perſon. For unto any teſtimony two things are required. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the manifeſting, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting that which is to be credited, or beleeved: <hi>Secondly,</hi> an ability in him to whom it is witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to underſtand it; otherwiſe the propoſing any thing by diſcourſe to a beaſt that wants rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to underſtand ſpeech, or the relating of any
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108952:62"/>thing to a man that hath reaſon, in the Greeke tongue, who underſtands no language but Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, is no teſtimony, no more then it is to a deafe man that cannot heare. Wherefore to make a divine teſtimony, there muſt be both a divine teſtimony unto a man, and withall a mind in him able to underſtand that revelation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt</hi> therefore, the Spirit of God muſt reveale and manifeſt unto a man that truth that is to be beleeved, as the light diſcovers any viſible object. <hi>Next</hi> there muſt be in that man a light planted in his heart (which the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.20. tearmes An underſtanding to know him that is true) as the light or viſuall faculty is planted in the eye, or elſe he cannot comprehend that light that ſhines unto him. For want of this inward light it was, that the Iſraelites who had ſeene with their bodily eyes all Gods wonders, and by reaſon were forced to acknowledge that they were wrought by the finger of God, yet are truly charged by <hi>Moſes,</hi> not to have an heart to perceive, nor eyes to ſee, nor eares to heare unto that day, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.4.</p>
                        <p>The evidence then which a true beleever hath of any truth of God,
<note place="margin">By way of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from conviction by reaſon.</note> which he embraceth, is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting of that truth unto the ſpirit, not onely by a form of words to the naturall underſtanding, but beyond that by a kind of Demonſtration unto the ſpirituall minde, as the evidence of any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the eye is by the ſhining of the light upon it, which makes it appeare to be ſuch as it is. This kind of teſtifying, or evidencing things in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108952:62"/>way the Apoſtle calls, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16.
<note place="margin">As repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the things themſelves in their proper ſpecies.</note> the <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing of Gods Spirit with our ſpirit,</hi> mentioning expreſly two ſpirits, whereof if either be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there can be no divine Teſtimony.</p>
                        <p>The beholding of Divine truths with a ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eye, repreſented by way of Demonſtration, is ſo neceſſary, that without it men could not be witneſſes,
<note place="margin">Without which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers could not be Gods witneſſes.</note> or at leaſt ſufficient witneſſes to Gods truth. For he that will teſtifie any thing upon cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, muſt ſee it with his owne eye, or diſcerne it by ſome other ſenſe of his owne. Otherwiſe he that teſtifieth a truth upon another mans relation, beares witneſſe rather to the relator, then to the truth related. So that to make men witneſſes to Gods truth, they muſt not onely have it related unto them, but beſides further manifeſted by way of Demonſtration and ſpirituall evidence, that they may ſay with the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>That we have ſeene with our eyes, and looked upon, declare we unto you.</hi> Which not onely winnes much credit with others, but mightily affects the perſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as it did <hi>Iob,</hi> when he thus ſaw God, <hi>Iob</hi> 42.5. and <hi>Abraham</hi> when he ſaw Chriſts day: <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.56.</p>
                        <p>It is evident then that true Faith is grounded upon a Divine teſtimony.
<note place="margin">Whereas Hiſtoricall faith reſts on an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony.</note> In the next place we muſt make it appeare, that Hiſtoricall faith relies onely upon an humane teſtimony. Now it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied that the truths of Divine myſteries though they cannot be found out by mans reaſon (as the Apoſtle tells us they never entred into mans heart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.) yet are they all conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108952:63"/>to right reaſon: and it is as evident that the teſtimony of reaſon,
<note place="margin">Embracing divine truths,</note> is an humane teſtimony. I ſay then, that hiſtoricall faith reſts not upon the evidence or demonſtration, but upon the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of divine truths,
<note place="margin">1. For the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then upon Gods teſtimony of them.</note> which therefore mans reaſon cannot but aſſent unto. For example: the Creation of the World, Reſurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Incarnation of Chriſt: and may be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by reaſon to be poſſible upon the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Almightineſſe, yea, and fit to be done by him, whoſe ſcope is to make knowne his Power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.8. and to magnifie his Word (that is,
<note place="margin">2. Or if on the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet upon an humane teſtimony. Becauſe he beleeves the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, 1. Either upon the Churches teſtimony of them. 2. Upon the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of truths de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered therein.</note> his mercy promiſed in his Word) above all his workes: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.2. to ſet out in ages to come the riches of his grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.7. So that howſoever theſe are Myſteries of faith, yet ſeeing Reaſon (which is an Humane teſtimony) may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, it is evident, that an Hiſtoricall faith beleeving theſe things for the Reaſonableneſſe of them, is but meerely upon an Humane Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</p>
                        <p>Nay, if he ſhould goe a ſteppe further and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve any thing that is written in the Scriptures, for the Teſtimony of the Scriptures, yet ſtill he beleeves upon an Humane teſtimony, becauſe he beleeves the Scriptures themſelves upon Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane teſtimony, as upon the generall conſent for the Church which receives the Scriptures, as the Word of God; or upon the probability and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nablenes; or of the things therein delivered, laſtly, upon the obſervation of the Truth of thoſe holy writings in moſt things, which makes them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108952:63"/>to be true in all. For the Aſſent unto one thing for another is built upon that, to which we firſt give our Aſſent. As a ſtone in a wall, though it lies immediately upon that ſtone that is next under it; yet is indeed ſupported by the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which beares up all the building.</p>
                        <p>We ſee then a wide Difference between Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Hiſtoricall faith, in the cauſe, ſubject and ground of Aſſurance; we ſhall finde no leſſe in the Object. Now the generall Object of Faith, we know, is Gods Word and Promiſe, which onely is a ſure ground to build Faith upon, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of the God of truth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4.
<note place="margin">A fourth difference betweene juſtifying and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall faith in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of both.</note> who cannot lye, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. or denie himſelfe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.23. or change his minde, <hi>Num.</hi> 23.19. So that his Word muſt needs be Everlaſting, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.144. founded for ever, <hi>v.</hi> 132. upon two unfailing foundations, his Everlaſting Truth, and unreſiſtible Power.</p>
                        <p>But the particular Object of juſtifying Faith is Gods Promiſe of Reconciliation, and Salvation by Chriſt, in whom onely we are Juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108952:64"/>but beſides, becauſe all is ſanctified and made good in Chriſt; for whom one findes it good to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt all things loſſe, not onely his owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. but his owne will and deſires, which he caſts aſide, deſiring to be guided by his Spirit, which is good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.10. ſeeking Wiſdome, Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</p>
                        <p>It is indeed impoſſible for any man to rely wholly on Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Without which one can never be brought to affect Chriſt with all his heart,</note> unleſſe his will be brought to chooſe, and deſire him for that excellency of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which is to be found in him, ſeeing God hath planted in all Creatures (man eſpecially) as ſtrong deſire of, or propenſion to their owne chiefeſt good, which cannot be deſtroyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deſtruction of Nature it ſelfe. So that a man will never be brought to denie all things for Chriſt; unleſſe he be well aſſured that he ſhall finde in Chriſt that ſufficiency that makes him more happy then all things can doe beſides.</p>
                        <p>Now it may be eaſily Demonſtrated, that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall faith, though it may aſſent unto the truth, yet cannot embrace the goodneſſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, made by God with man in Chriſt. For how can he who never yet learned to deny himſelfe (which no naturall man can doe) thinke it good to abhor his owne righteouſneſſe, or be pleaſed to have no ability in himſelf to any good, no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his owne, no will of his owne, but to fetch all his Wiſdome, Righteouſneſſe, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Redemption from Chriſt? to take onely the Will of Chriſt for his Rule? To referre
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108952:64"/>the glory of his beſt works unto God alone, and to his honour, as our Saviour requires, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. and the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.</p>
                        <p>So then howſoever Hiſtoricall, and Juſtifying faith, ſeeme to embrace the ſame object, namely the promiſe of Salvation by Chriſt; yet to ſpeake properly, it is the ſame onely Materially, but not Formally; becauſe though they embrace the ſame promiſe, yet they embrace not the ſame thing in that promiſe: Hiſtoricall faith acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it to be true, but onely Iuſtifying faith beleeves it to be good, at the leaſt to be good in particular, to himſelfe that beleeves.</p>
                        <p>From this different apprehenſion of the object of Faith, ariſeth another difference between theſe two kinds of Faith, in the Minde of him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves.
<note place="margin">As a true Beleever doth.</note> For a true Beleever having in himſelfe by the Spirit a cleere Evidence, not only of the truth; but beſides, of the goodneſſe of the Promiſe which he beleeves, and that to himſelfe in particular, is ſtrongly carried after it with all the deſires, and affections of his Soule, cloſing not onely with the Promiſe, but with Chriſt himſelfe, tendred unto him therein. For in all Regular Motions of the Spirit of man (ſuch as were <hi>Adams</hi> in his innocency, and ſuch as are thoſe that are in the regenerate, as farre as they are regenerate,) the Will is ſo guided by the Underſtanding, that when that judgeth any thing to be the chiefeſt good, the other cannot chooſe but embrace it. So that a man clearely apprehending, and judging that there is no true happineſſe to be found but in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:108952:65"/>Chriſt, the whole heart neceſſarily relieth upon him, and cloſeth fully with him, denying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholly, both in opinion and judgement, and in purpoſe and choice.</p>
                        <p>Thus farre a true Beleever goes in embracing Chriſt.
<note place="margin">But a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</note> How neare one that hath no more but Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall faith, may come unto him, we are now to enquire. The comming on of ſuch a perſon towards Chriſt, our Saviour himſelfe deſcribeth unto us in that parable of the Sower, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20, 21, 22. but more clearely the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. who ſets out before us the diſtinct ſteps, and degrees by which one may advance forwards towards the entertaining of the Promiſes of Salvation, and Life, and yet fall ſhort at the laſt.</p>
                        <p>To begin therefore with the Apoſtles expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in that place, he tells us that one which may afterwards fall away (and therefore was never truly one of Chriſts, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.19.) may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be inlightned,
<note place="margin">Although he may</note> may taſte of the Heavenly gift, may be Partaker of the Holy Ghoſt, may taſte of the good Word of God, and Powers of the World to come. Theſe particulars it will be needfull to examine ſeverally in their order. That a naturall man may be the gift of Illumination,
<note place="margin">Be inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</note> underſtand more of the Myſteries of Godlineſſe, then his naturall reaſon could teach him, no man can deny; and we have already ſhewed that this may be done without any change of the heart, onely by the Improvement of Naturall Reaſon, by the light of the Spirit.</p>
                        <p>Now when a man is thus inlightned, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108952:65"/>by reaſon of the truth of thoſe divine Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,

And may have ſome Taſte of the Heavenly Gift.</note> he may very well have ſome pleaſing taſte of that Heavenly gift mentioned in the next place, not onely the gift of tongues, and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying, called the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. whereof the Apoſtle acknowledgeth that men out of the ſtate of Grace may be partakers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. But beſides of Chriſt himſelfe, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and free mercies of God beſtowed in him, called the gift of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.10. and things free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given us of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. which the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary beleever, apprehending, and obſerving, that they promiſe much good unto man, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be delighted withall.</p>
                        <p>But this delight which ſuch a man hath in theſe heavenly gifts, can be but a taſte, as the Apoſtle calls it, ſuch as one hath of things that he never takes down, nor much leſſe digeſts to receive any true ſtrength thereby in the Inward man.
<note place="margin">Which comes far ſhort. of that full content which true Beleevers finde in Chriſt,</note> Such a taſte the Hearer had, reſembled by the ſtony ground, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.21. affecting him with a preſent Joy, and Delight, as thoſe things doe that have a pleaſant taſte: ſuch the <hi>Iewes</hi> found in <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> Doctrine, wherein they rejoyced for a ſeaſon, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.35.

                        <p>For if it be well conſidered,
<note place="margin">As being grounded on a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,</note> a temporary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers taſte of heavenly things, we ſhall finde to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108952:66"/>ariſe out of a double miſtake. Firſt, of the Nature of the Benefits offered to us in Chriſt,
<note place="margin">1.

Now this conceit of ſome carnall, and temporall good, which is to be found in Chriſt, may worke in a man ſome deſire after him, and delight in the Word, in which he is publiſhed, and propoſed: ſuch a conceit, that Chriſt ſhould be a temporall Prince, wrought upon the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and wonne them to entertaine our Saviour for a time, but when they ſaw, that his Kingdome was not of this World, as himſelfe ſpeakes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.36. they ſoone forſooke him, ſo <hi>Ioh</hi> 6.15.24.66.</p>
                        <p>This firſt Miſtake is ſeconded by another,
<note place="margin">2. Of the conditions under which they are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered:</note> no leſſe them the former, wherein they miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand both the conditions under which Chriſt is offered, and the ſervices which he requires. For a Carnall man hearing of the large offers of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Peace, ſo freely tendred, deſires them and hopes to gaine them at an eaſie rate. But upon farther enquiry finding, that neither Chriſt nor any of his benefits are to be had without renouncing the World, nay, denying himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. he is offended, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.21. and turnes away with a ſad heart,
<note place="margin">Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he may be moved to doe, or fuffer ſome thing for Chriſt;</note> and diſcontented like the young man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.21.22.</p>
                        <p>Such a man it may be at his firſt entertaining the Word, while his affections are warme and freſh, for Chriſts ſake may ſuſtaine ſome reproach, and make ſome ſmall loſſes, and ſacrifice ſome of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108952:66"/>his weaker luſts at Gods command, hoping to ſatisfie him thereby: as <hi>Saul</hi> attempted to doe, by deſtroying the raſcall multitude, and carion cattle of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.9.13. So dealt <hi>Herod</hi> with <hi>Iohn Baptiſt, Marke</hi> 6.20. when he ſaw that nothing would ſatisfie him unleſſe he would part with his Darling <hi>Herodias,</hi> he forſooke him and became his utter enemy, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.</p>
                        <p>And no marvell if onely a taſte of Spirituall things,

                        <p>Theſe conſiderations which a temporary belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cannot brooke, a true Beleever eaſily ſubmits unto. As well upon a full diſcovery of the vanity, and emptineſſe of all things ſave Chriſt: <hi>Phil.</hi>

<note place="margin">2. And finding them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable to his renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nature.</note> as alſo upon the cleare manifeſtation of the infinite value of Chriſt, and all the Heavenly Treaſures, which are laid up in him; which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Moſes</hi> to make more accompt of him with reproach, then of the treaſures of <hi>Aegypt, Heb.</hi> 11.26.

                        <p>Again, a temporary beleever miſtakes the duties required of a Chriſtian, as much as he doth the conditions.

<note place="margin">Whereas a true Belec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtickes neither at the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions nor the Duties.</note> and renounceth his ſervice, <hi>ver.</hi> 66.</p>

                        <p>Thus then a temporary beleever,
<note place="margin">Wherefore Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers muſt needs fall off at laſt: but a true Beleever ſtands faſt to the end.</note> grounding his reſolution to embrace Chriſt, and his Law, upon ſuch groſſe errours, muſt needes waver and fall off when he finds his miſtake: Whereas a true belever, underſtanding truly what Chriſt is whom he chooſeth, and what are his Lawes and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and finding by experience his bargaine no worſe then he conceived it, ſtands ſtill to his firſt choiſe, and as <hi>Boaz</hi> liking the woman, as well as her inheritance, willingly tooke them both, <hi>Ruth</hi> 4.9, 10. which his Kinſman refuſed, becauſe he could not have the land alone, being all that he ſought after: So the Godly, liking Chriſt,

                        <p>A Second Difference between a True and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary beleevers taſte, is in the Proper object of them both. For that which a true beleever findes ſweet unto him, is Chriſt himſelfe, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and ſpirituall Treaſures that he brings with him: In which a temporary beleever findes no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh at all, but that which affects him, is ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed carnall commoditie or Temporall good, which he hopes to gaine by Chriſt: Like one who taking Pills wrapt in Sugar, taſtes onely the Sugar, but not the Pill it ſelfe,

                        <p>Thus farre we have deſcribed the Temporary Beleevers taſte of the heavenly gift: the like reliſh unto this he hath of the good Word of God;
<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of true and temporary Beleevers taſte in the Word of God.</note> Now that may ariſe, either from the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of the knowledge revealed therein, (which affected the <hi>Iewes</hi> in <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> Miniſtery, as our Saviour tells them, <hi>John</hi> 5.35. As it did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Athenians</hi> in S. <hi>Pauls, Acts</hi> 17.20, 21.) or at the moſt from the large promiſes expreſſed therein, which alſo (as hath beene intimated) he underſtands carnally, and hoping to gaine to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe an intereſt in them, upon that falſe ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition he is tranſported with a carnall joy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,

                        <p>The next thing that affects a temporary Beleever is the powers of the world to come;
<note place="margin">Their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent taſte of the powers of the world to come.</note> So he cals that future, heavenly, bleſſed condition of the Saints, called the power of an endleſſe life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.16. not like this preſent eſtate, weake and infirme, but full of power and glory, called therefore a glorious inheritance, 1 <hi>Eph.</hi> 18. and Glory which ſhall be revealed in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. a Kingdome that cannot be ſhaken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. whereunto our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies laid downe in Weakeneſſe, ſhall be raiſed up in Power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.43. Now a temporary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, miſtaking and apprehending this eſtate to be ſome outward happineſſe, and hoping to have ſome title to ſuch a Glorious Condition, may pleaſe himſelfe with that phantaſie for a ſeaſon, and ſo may ſeeme to finde ſome ſweetneſſe in the powers of the World to come, which if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand aright, he would finde no delight in, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſutable to his diſpoſition.</p>

                        <p>The third reſemblance between this ground, and the Temporary Beleever is, that as in the ſtony ground wanting depth of earth, the ſeed can take no ſtrong roote in it, to yeeld ſufficient nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it may hold out when the heate comes: So the Word which enters not into the depth,

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108952:70"/>ſo ſodainly as the former, and yet, though it wither not,
<note place="margin">Which bath more depth of earth, more ſetledneſſe in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reſolution. But for the want of cleanſing the heart of worldly cares, and preaſures, failes in the end. Wanting a cleare light to diſcover fully the excellency of Chriſt, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Creature.</note> but hold the Roote and Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſtill, it brings no fruit at all to perfection, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.14. Such an one was <hi>Demas,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. This Beleever is neither ſo heady nor ſodaine in his affection, or profeſſion, as is the former: And yet although he knowes more of God and Chriſt, and embraceth the Profeſſion of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with more adviſed deliberation and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution then the former doth, for all that, for want of cleanſing his heart of his inbred corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereof earthly mindedneſſe is the chiefe, he comes to nought at laſt.</p>
                        <p>The fault of this Beleever is, that though his judgement be convinced of the excellency of God lineſſe, notwithſtanding he wants that cleare Spirituall Evidence of it, which onely is able to winne the whole heart to embrace it, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon all things for it, with S. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.8. And withall, he never yet had a like full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the vanity, and emptineſſe of thoſe earthly things, that bewitch his heart, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to retaine the love of them ſtill.

                        <p>This then being the nature of Hiſtoricall faith; under which, that which is Temporary is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, the difference betweene that and true Juſtifying faith, appeares in theſe ſixe things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> in the cauſe,

                        <p>It is true that this true Beleever, though he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres firmly to Chriſt in his reſolution; yet he followes him not ſo fully ſometimes, in the courſe of his practice, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> complaines of himſelfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15.19.23. and <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.176. which happens not onely by the luſting of the fleſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

                        <p>This man may be likened to a Country newly Conquered,

<note place="margin">Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in generall deſcribed is,</note> may be deſcribed to be the Diſcovery by Senſe, and Knowledge thereby, of ſomething not evident in it ſelfe, but manifeſted by ſome Event or Effect. This generall Deſcription of Experience, may eaſily be applyed, both unto that which is Naturall, and to that which is Spirituall. The later of theſe two being not eaſily underſtood in it ſelf, (unleſſe it be of thoſe that finde it in themſelves) &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hard to be expreſſed, may not unfitly be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by the former, which is well underſtood of all.

                        </p>
                        <p>Experience we affirme to be a Knowledge, not infuſed, but acquired, out of the Obſervation of the Events or Effects by Senſe,
<note place="margin">Whereby Reaſon gueſſeth at ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares not.</note> whereby Reaſon being informed, gueſſeth at ſome inward, and ſecret cauſe, whence they proceed.

<note place="margin">2. Of things not Evident in themſelves but mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by Events, or Effects.</note> moved to take or leave things which they finde agreeable or hurtfull to themſelves. This kinde of knowledge being grounded on ſenſe, is uſually moſt certaine, and generally moſt affects.</p>
                        <p>This Experience muſt be of ſuch things as are not manifeſt in themſelves, but are onely diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:108952:72"/>by the Effect, as that Hony is ſweet, and Wormwood bitter, becauſe the taſte by often taking them proves them to be ſo, though neither of them can be outwardly diſcerned. But we are not ſo properly ſaid to know Snow to be white by experience, becauſe it appeares ſo to the eye, or to know a Man by experience, when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold one whom we never ſaw before: But when by his Actions, Words, and Converſation, we diſcover the inward diſpoſition of his minde, which appeares not outwardly, we are properly ſaid to know him by experience.</p>
                        <p>That inward thing,
<note place="margin">Which may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or the very thing it ſelfe, if it be of a Spirituall Nature.</note> which Experience thus diſcovers, is oftentimes a quality in ſome ſubject or other, as that Fire is hot, and Snow cold. Sometimes the very ſubject it ſelfe, if it be a thing inviſible, is likewiſe diſcovered by Experience. As by Experience I know that there be Windes, though I never ſaw them, becauſe I have heard the ſound, and felt the violence of them, as our Saviour ſpeakes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.8. So the Experience of Gods Workes, manifeſts that there is a God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 58.11. though no man hath ſeene him at any time, <hi>John</hi> 1.18.</p>
                        <p>That there is ſuch a kinde of Naturall Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as we have ſpoken of,
<note place="margin">That there is Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> all men will readily acknowledge, becauſe all men finde it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; whether there be any Spirituall Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is no marvell though many men doubt, becauſe there be ſo few that have it. For if few men had the ſenſe of ſight, and all the reſt of the world were blinde, the generality of men, that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:108952:72"/>never had the benefit of ſeeing, might perhaps doubt whether there were any ſuch thing as light, or colours, or ſight, or no. Now that there muſt be Spirituall Experience, if there be Spirituall Senſe, no man can deny: And that there is ſuch Spirituall Senſe, is evident by the Apoſtles Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, expreſly naming Senſes by which men diſcerne betwixt good and evill: <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. And when <hi>Moſes</hi> acknowledgeth that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had ſeene Gods wonders,
<note place="margin">And there is Spirituall Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is proved.</note> and yet denies that they had eyes to ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.4. he evidently implyes that there is a double Senſe, one outward and Naturall, and another inward and Spirituall.</p>
                        <p>To make this truth, that there is ſuch a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull Senſe, yet more manifeſt,
<note place="margin">If there be Spirituall Senſe, there muſt needs be Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. There is ſuch a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Senſe;</note> let us but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Godly mens Affections, and whence, and how they are raiſed. For that affections are moſt commonly, and alwaies moſt effectually moved by fenſe, it is evident: wherefore if there be Spirituall Affections, it muſt needs be granted that there be Spirituall Senſes that move them. Now that <hi>Davids</hi> longing after God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1.21. Pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after his Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.140. Delight in the ſweetneſſe of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 103.
<note place="margin">1. Becauſe there are Spirituall Affections</note> Trembling at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>ver.</hi> 120. Griefe for breach of his Laws, <hi>ver.</hi> 136. Zeale for it, <hi>ver.</hi> 139. and for his houſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.9. are Spirituall affections, is apparent, ſeeing they were raiſed by Spirituall objects, and conſequently the Senſe, that apprehending them begat theſe Affections, muſt be Spirituall.
<note place="margin">2. Becauſe there is an ability to diſcerne and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>A farther argument, that theſe Senſes are Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, is this, that by them men are able to diſcover
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:108952:73"/>not onely Spirituall things from Carnall, but Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things themſelves one from another, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Spirituall things with Spirituall things, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13. And that not onely in their generall natures, (for ſo farre the underſtanding may judge of them) but the very particular ſubſiſtence of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<note place="margin">And Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things one from another.</note> Thus a Godly man that hath the motions of carnall joyes, feares, ſorrows &amp;c. when he feeles the like affections in Spirituall things, is able to ſay of both, this feare, joy, or griefe, is Spirituall, and that is carnall. And when he hath felt Spirituall Agonies and heart-breakings, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſay when they come againe, theſe are the very ſame that afflicted my ſoule heretofore: as a woman, that hath felt the Throwes of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, can ſay when ſhe feeles them againe, theſe are the paines of travell.</p>
                        <p>Againe,
<note place="margin">3 Becauſe men finde inward comfort, and eaſe by Spirituall objects. But none in outward and carnall things.</note> when Godly men finding themſelves afflicted in ſpirit, finde by their owne experience, that carnall comforts releeve and eaſe them, no more then <hi>Iacobs</hi> Children and Wives did him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.35. or then <hi>Iobs</hi> friends helped him in his diſtreſſe, whom he calls Miſerable comforters, <hi>Iob</hi> 16.2. But for all that carnall reaſon can ſay unto them, they remaine ſtill in darkneſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light, as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. till God make them heare the voyce of Joy, and Gladneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. till a Meſſenger in his Name aſſure them that there is a ranſome accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them, <hi>Iob</hi> 33.24. I ſay, when carnall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts worke nothing on them, but onely Spirituall
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:108952:73"/>comforts eaſe their hearts, as Gods word quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.50.92. it manifeſtly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a Spirituall ſenſe within, which is affected with nothing but that which is Spirituall.</p>
                        <p>Of this Spirituall Senſe,
<note place="margin">4. Becauſe the ſame ſpirituall objects that affect the godly at ſome times, at other times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them not.</note> this is a farther Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the ſame things propoſed to the ſame, or divers men, though all godly, affect them not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like at all times, ſometimes moving the heart in a ſtrong manner, whereas at another time they have little or no operation at all. That meſſage, that God had accepted a Ranſome, had a great effect upon that diſtreſſed Man, <hi>Iob</hi> 33.24. in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving his ſpirit: the ſame meſſage by the mouth of <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. wrought nothing for the preſent upon <hi>Davids</hi> heart, which remained broken ſtill, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. And generally all godly men finde by their owne experience, that thoſe inſtructions, reproofes, and conſolations which at ſome times awaken, wound, and revive their ſpirits, at another, move them no more either way then a charme doth a deafe Adder, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.4.
<note place="margin">Which muſt needs happen, becauſe Spirituall Senſe is at ſometimes bepum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and awakened at other times.</note> Now they being ſtill men of ſpirituall mindes, and at all times under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alike thoſe things that are propoſed, no reaſon can be given, why they are ſo ineffectuall at one time, and powerfull at another, but this, that at ſome times, Spirituall Senſe being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed, they then heare onely by the hearing of the eare, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Iob</hi> 42.5. but at other times when thoſe ſenſes be awakened, they taſte, and ſee, and feele the ſame, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently are affected as <hi>Iob</hi> was in that place,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:108952:74"/>and <hi>Iacob</hi> when he ſaw the Chariots ſent to bring him into <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 45.27.</p>

                     <p>It is true that, beſides the Sabbath day, God hath limited to men no certain time for the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Prayer and ſtudy of the Scriptures, only we have generall commands to be frequent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall in Prayer, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.17. and diligent in meditation of the Word, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 1.8.

<note place="margin">1. The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. 1. The morning is a ſit time, for Prayer &amp; Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> the Morning was one of the three times wherein <hi>David</hi> preſented his prayers unto God. Now although Prayer and Reading of the Word be two diſtinct exerciſes, yet that they mutually help one another, is moſt manifeſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are fit to be joyned together. For the Word miniſters matter of Prayer, and is the

Again Prayer muſt needs awe us with the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Gods Majeſty, and conſequently prepare our hearts to tremble at Gods word in reading it, which God is well pleaſed withall, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 96.2.</p>
                     <p>The fitneſſe of the Morning for theſe exerciſes is evident:
<note place="margin">1. As it is fit to honour God with the firſt of our time.</note> not only becauſe the firſt of our time, as of all things elſe, belongs unto God, whoſe ſervice ought to be our ſpeciall and chiefeſt care: but beſides,
<note place="margin">2. The heart in the morning is freeſt from worldly thoughts.</note> becauſe the heart, being then moſt free from worldly thoughts, is fitteſt for holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations. And withall when in the beginning of the day the heart of a man is ſeaſoned with holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and with the feare of God, he findes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the better fitted, to walk humbly with him all the day after.</p>
                     <p>It is very fit to cloſe up the day with theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wherewith we began it.
<note place="margin">2.

Then indeed it is fit to paſſe our accompts with God, concerning our carriage the day before, that having made all our reckonings even with him, we may with aſſurance lay down our ſelves to reſt in peace. Now, we have already intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, how fit it is to joyne Prayer and Reading to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo that if the Evening be a fit time for Prayer, it muſt be acknowledged to be fit for Reading alſo.</p>

                     <p>This time allotted for the reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures muſt not onely be proportioned to the worke,

<note place="margin">Yet all muſt ſet a part ſome time for this duty;</note> even thoſe who are moſt ſtraightned by the buſineſſe of their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, muſt notwithſtanding ſo order their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, that they ſpare ſome fit portion of time for theſe duties of Gods ſervice: who can eaſily recompence it unto them by proſpering their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and aſſures us that he will be no mans debtor for the leaſt ſervice done for him, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                     <p>Of two things men are to be admoniſhed. <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Three ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veats, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, 1. Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. 2. Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance with too much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> that they bring not themſelves into ſtraights of time, either by negligence in their callings, which often puts them to labour at unſeaſonable times, or by loading themſelves unneceſſarily with multiplicity of buſineſſe, and worldly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which when they have undertaken, being not able to diſpatch in convenient times, they take liberty to make uſe of thoſe times for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affaires that are fit to be ſet apart for holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. By either of theſe wayes, men being drawn to omit theſe duties at the firſt, at laſt by diſuſe of practiſe loſe withall the very deſire and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to performe them. Theſe muſt know that God, in matters of his ſervice, diſpenſeth with inevitable, but not with voluntary neceſſities. He will indeed have Mercy, and not Sacrifice, but
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108952:80"/>neither negligence, nor covetouſneſſe, rather then Sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. Not to miſtake ſuſpenſion for a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the duty.</note> men muſt take heed that they miſtake not a diſpenſation for ſuſpending theſe duties, for a full diſcharge from them. Employments in ſecular affaires are not better then holy duties, neither is the ſervice of men, better then the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. Conſequently the one ought not to be left for the other: Onely, whereas our affaires are ſo limited to their ſeaſon, that they muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be done at preſent, or not at all, whereas holy duties ſuſpended for a time, may be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med afterwards, God is pleaſed that his Services ſhall give precedence to our urgent neceſſities, not that they ſhall be excluded by them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that by inevitable neceſſity is enforced to omit Prayer or Reading in the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, muſt redeeme the firſt opportunity for the performance of them, as ſoone as he may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                     <p>This holy exerciſe of Reading the Scriptures daily being every way ſo neceſſary, ſo comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo profitable, let all that deſire to grow in knowledge, Faith, and Obedience, that expect Gods bleſſing upon their ſoules, and labours, attend daily at the gates of Wiſdome, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.34. encouraged by that gratious promiſe, We ſhall know the Lord if we follow on to know him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.3.

                     </head>
                     <p>OF what neceſſity carefull Preparation is to the Reading of the Scriptures, hath beene ſufficiently manifeſted in the firſt Chapter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſhewed that the Truths revealed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are in themſelves deepe and great Myſteries, that our underſtanding is ſhallow, and full of darkeneſſe, and thereby unable to comprehend them. Laſtly, that our rebellious carnall diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are, with great difficulty, brought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit fully to Gods will revealed, much more to delight in it as we ought. We are now to ſhew what this Preparation is, and wherein it ſpecially conſiſts.</p>
                     <p>There needs indeed unto this work a double Preparation,
<note place="margin">Adouble Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. 1. To the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking and reſolving upon the duty: 1. For the ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our nature.</note> 
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> to the undertaking. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> to the performance of this duty. For the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of the work it ſelfe, we need to be prepared with a firme and conſtant reſolution, before we goe about it. Partly, becauſe of the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſſe of our carnall natures to holy duties, and our inconſtancy and unſtedfaſtneſſe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting and going thorough with them to the end: (which moved holy <hi>David</hi> to ſtrengthen himſelfe thereunto with a ſolemne oath, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.106.) and partly becauſe we know how dangerous it
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:108952:81"/>is to put ones hand to the Plough and looke back againe,
<note place="margin">2. For the danger of breaking of the work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne. To this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution we muſt be ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, 1. By the ſenſe of our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> 
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.62. which moved the ſame Prophet to reſolve and promiſe to perform Gods Statutes alway even to the end, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.112.</p>
                     <p>Now the grounds, upon which our hearts muſt be ſetled in the firmneſſe of ſuch reſolutions, muſt be drawn: <hi>Firſt,</hi> from the ſenſe of our own blindneſſe and ignorance, who of our ſelves have not the knowledge nor underſtanding of a man, as <hi>Agur</hi> acknowledgeth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.3. as indeed every man is brutiſh by his owne knowledge, <hi>Ier.</hi> 51.17. and withall by that ignorance of ours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alienated from the life of God, and paſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without ſpeciall grace preventing, are given over to all laſciviouſneſſe, as the Apoſtle ſets out ſuch a condition, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.17, 18. made to be enſnared and taken for a prey, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.22. Nay, beſides that we are men of untractable ſpirits, naturally averſe from, and oppoſite to, all Gods Counſells, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. and bent in our own reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to doe what is good in our owne eyes, though we ſay not ſo much in expreſſe tearmes, with the <hi>Iewes, Ier.</hi> 44.16. All which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions laid together, are great motives to awaken our hearts, to apply our ſelves to the ſtudy of the Scriptures,
<note place="margin">2. By aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that this is the onely meanes ordaned by God to help both.</note> as the onely meanes to inlighten our eyes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7.8. and to ſubdue the thoughts of the heart to the obedience of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> we muſt be well aſſured, that there is no other meanes ordained by God, but the Word alone to help us out of this dangerous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That is the light that ſhines unto us out of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:108952:81"/>a darke place, to which we muſt take heed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. the onely light to our ſteps, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105. Without which whoſoever ſpeakes, there is no light in him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 20.8. now as there is no other meanes of true knowledge but the Word, ſo we muſt underſtand that this is ſo full of heavenly Wiſdome, that it is able to make one wiſe to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. Wiſer then our teachers then our enemies, then the ancient, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.98, 99, 100. And that it is not more full of wiſdome then of power, quicke and powerfull, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. the Power of God to Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. able to clenſe the wayes even of young men, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.9. in a word, ſufficient to convert the ſoule, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19.7.</p>
                     <p>The heart of man being thus once ſenſible of the miſerable, and dangerous bondage, into which it is brought by ignorance, and perverſneſſe, and being with all aſſured, that the Word is both a lampe, and light, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.23. and beſides that, as a fire and hammer, as it is reſembled, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.29. able by the power of God, to maſter and bring under thoſe rebellious thoughts of the ſpirit, which no earthly power can ſubdue: cannot but be effectually moved to a reſolution, and earneſt deſire to make uſe of it for the freeing himſelfe, in that dangerous condition in which he ſtands at preſent, by his blindneſſe, and perverſeneſſe of ſpirit. As it fared with <hi>Iacob,</hi> who ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before his eyes, but famine, and death, when he had once beene informed that there was corne in <hi>Egypt,</hi> reſolved to have it whatſoever
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:108952:82"/>it coſt, yea though he were to hazard his beloved <hi>Benjamin</hi> in the voyage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.1. and 43.24. As likewiſe, upon the ſame conſideration, the lepers adventured their lives in the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> campe, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.4, 5. And indeed a deſire kindled in the heart of a man, upon ſuch effectuall motives, will neither ſuffer him to be idle, like the ſlothfull man who had rather ſtarve then labour, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.25, 26. nor yet wavering and unconſtant, becauſe he will ſtill finde in himſelfe the ſame powerfull motives urging him forward to goe on in this worke, which drew him unto the undertaking of it at the beginning.</p>
                     <p>But the moſt prevalent meanes,
<note place="margin">3. By the delight which we may finde in the uſe of it.</note> to keep a man on conſtant in the uſe of this holy Ordinance, eſpecially with deſire and cheerfulneſſe, is not ſo much the great neceſſity that drives him to it, as the delight that he finds in the Word, for the wonderfull wiſedome revealed therein, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.129. the Purity of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 140. together with the abſolute perfection of it every way, which drew holy <hi>David</hi> to the continuall Meditation of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 96, 97. yea for the ſweetneſſe of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 103. ariſing out of the ſutableneſſe of it to his ſanctified Nature, but moſt of all for the great profit that it brings ſundry wayes,

                     <p>A mans heart, being thus confirmed with a full purpoſe, and ſetled reſolution, to undertake, and continue conſtantly in the ſtudy of the holy
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:108952:82"/>Scriptures, muſt be more particularly prepared to the work it ſelfe when one goes about it. In the <hi>firſt</hi> place one muſt be carefull to free himſelf from all incumbrances that peſter the heart. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> he muſt awe his heart with a holy reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence both of the Word it ſelfe, and of him that ſpeakes in and by it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the ſoule muſt be quickned with a ſpirituall appetite and deſire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Faith muſt be ſtirred up and ſtrengthened ot believe it. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> the heart muſt be made ſoft and tender to admit and entertain it. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> all muſt be cloſed up with an effectuall prayer, for the Spirits aſſiſtance, to give life and power to the Word, to work upon the heart and conſcience effectually.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> work,
<note place="margin">1. By cleanſing the heart.</note> when we come to read the Scriptures, is to cleanſe the heart, as men do the ground where they caſt in their ſeed, that we ſow not among thornes, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.3. Unleſſe veſſels be emptied, whatſoever we powre into them runnes over.
<note place="margin">1. Of all naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> Now the heart muſt be cleared in generall of all ſuperfluity and naughtines, <hi>Iames</hi> 1.21, and particularly of worldly cares which choak the word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.22.
<note place="margin">2. Of all worldly thoughts.</note> and of all manner of diſtracting thoughts, of what nature ſoever, which muſt needs hinder attention while we are about this ſerious work. And laſtly, of all unquiet paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of anger, feare, joy, ſorrow, &amp;c.
<note place="margin">3.

<note place="margin">2.

This pliableneſſe of heart we are brought unto, by caſting aſide of our owne wills and wiſdome, which ſtiffen our hearts againſt Gods counſells, as appeares by thoſe rebellious Jewes, <hi>Ier.</hi> 44.16. Indeed a very foole is more tractable then one that is wiſe in his own eyes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.12. This tenderneſſe is called opening of the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. which is the work of the Spirit, much furthered, by awing our hearts with a reverend feare of his Majeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom we ſtand.

This attention we may be moved unto, by conſidering the perſon that ſpeakes, and the nature of that which is ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>The authority and wiſdome of him that ſpeaks requires great attention of him that reads or hears Gods Word.
<note place="margin">Required 1. From the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and wiſdome of him that ſpeakes.</note> A child muſt hear his Father, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.1. A ſubject muſt attend reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the words of a Ruler, <hi>Iob</hi> 29.21. Yet none of them is our potter as God is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.4. or made us as he did, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 100.3. nor conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can challenge ſuch reſpect from us as he may. Gods people muſt heare becauſe it is God that ſpeakes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.1. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 50.7. and 81.7. Beſides, the wiſdome of God requires our diligent attention, as it is required upon that ground, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 49.2, 3. now it is Chriſt that ſpeaks in his Word, who is the wiſdome of his Father, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. in whom are hidden the treaſures of wiſdome, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3.</p>
                     <p>Again,
<note place="margin">2. From the Subject which the Scriptures handle.</note> the Matter or Subject which is handled in the Scriptures requires of us great attention, not only for the weight and importance of thoſe high myſteries, which are therein revealed; But
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:108952:85"/>beſides that for the great intereſt which we our ſelves have in thoſe things which we find in that ſacred volume, as being directed unto us,

So that we have great reaſon to attend diligently to every tittle written in this book, much more heedfully then <hi>Benhadads</hi> Meſſengers did to the words of <hi>Ahab.</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.33.</p>
                     <p>Beſides,

<note place="margin">Some of them unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual.</note> and therefore not ſo eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, unleſs they be carefully obſerved. Thus S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us of many things in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles hard to be underſtood, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. Partly, becauſe the Scriptures themſelves being as they are very copious and full of matter (as <hi>David</hi> tels us the Law is exceeding broad, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 119.96.) are oftentimes brief and ſhort in the Phraſes and expreſſions, whence it muſt needs follow,
<note place="margin">Moſt of them brief and of large ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> that the words muſt needs be of large ſignification, ſo that, if they be not well obſerved, much of the matter contained in them may eaſily be loſt.</p>

                     <p>Unto this Attention muſt be joyned judicious Obſervation,
<note place="margin">Unto at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention adde obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſpeciall paſſages,</note> which is nothing elſe but the fixing and ſtaying of the mind upon ſome ſpeciall paſſage where we find things repreſented unto us either more weighty in themſelves, or elſe more proper to our ſelves, for our particular uſe and occaſions. It is true, that all Gods Teſtimonies are wonderfull in themſelves,

<note place="margin">A third du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and affent to what we read.</note> there muſt neceſſarily be joyned Approbation of every truth revealed in the Scriptures, ſuch as we: find in holy <hi>David, Pſalme</hi> 119.128. not onely becauſe Gods Law is the truth, <hi>verſe</hi> 142. and therefore muſt be approved by us,
<note place="margin">1. Becauſe it is the truth of God. 2.

                     <p>This aſſent which we give unto Gods Word,
<note place="margin">This aſſent is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, only voluntary, but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</note> in approving whatſoever it preſents unto us, is neither forced nor onely voluntary, but rather neceſſary, as is the judgment of ſenſe. For when the eye judgeth of colours, or the taſte of meates, it is not in the power of either of theſe ſenſes to judge otherwiſe of them, then they appeare to the ſenſe that apprehends them. This approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe ſeverall truths which are contained therein, is an acknowledgment that they are not only righteous and true, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.137, 138. with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> but withall with the Apoſtle, that they are good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.16. as alſo the Prophet acknowledgeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.19. which is the onely meanes to bring our hearts to love, and delight in them, which indeed is the fulleſt teſtimony that we can give to the perfection, purity, and excellency of them every way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.96.140.</p>
                     <p>It is true that every godly man, at all times, gives his aſſent to every truth of God revealed unto him, but the help of that Anointing which abideth in him, and teacheth him all things,

Such a full clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of our hearts, with every particular truth which we meet with in reading Gods Word, we are to labour for, and to pray for: and indeed
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108952:87"/>when men clearely diſcerne the glory,
<note place="margin">But when it ſhines to us clearly tranſports the heart with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

                     <p>It happens ſomtimes, that ſuch Spirituall Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſeize on a man, even while he is reading the Scriptures, (as the Diſciples hearts burned within them, whileſt our Saviour talked with them, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Emaus, Luke</hi> 24.32.) whereupon the heart opens it ſelfe, to cloſe with, and draw in that raviſhing Object, as it is probable <hi>Davids</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.131. which will neceſſarily enforce him to make ſome pauſe in the worke which he hath in hand, for a little while; which muſt need hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, partly becauſe the minde while it is wholly taken up with that truth which it embraceth, cannot eaſily attend any thing elſe, at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as it falls out, that when a mans eyes are dazled with beholding the Sunne, they can for the preſent ſee nothing elſe perfectly: And partly, becauſe ſuch new begotten affections, ſeeing they are kindled in an heart too ſluggiſh of it ſelfe, neede to be cheriſhed and kept alive, leſt they languiſh and grow cold againe, as fire if it be kindled in greene wood, goeth quickly out if it be not quickned a while by blowing.</p>

The truth is, ſuch a pauſe neede not detaine us long, but the affections being refreſhed by ſome ſhort meditation on that which moves them, a man may ſet on to the worke againe, and after that is fully ended, he may reſume againe into his thoughts, and ſatisfie himſelfe with the fuller contemplation of that object, that ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected him.</p>

                     <p>Such places of Scripture, as either expreſſe unto us Myſteries hard to be underſtood, or ſet them out in darke and unuſuall Phraſes of ſpeech, (of which ſort S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells there be many in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.) need to be the more diligently ſcanned, and if our own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be too weak to ſearch into the meaning of them, we may doe well to make uſe of other mens writings, or conference.

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> we muſt conſider, that the Law is not ſo much broken by ſlips and infirmities (for in the middeſt of them one may, and a Godly man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes doth, juſtifie the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.16, 22.) as by ſinnes of preſumption, ſuch as are mentioned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 44.16. when a man ſinnes wilfully, and prepares not himſelfe to doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods will, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.47, 48. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man hath no reaſon to apply to himſelfe the curſes of the Law, for ſuch ſlips of infirmity which are threatned onely againſt ſuch as are

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108952:90"/>2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.30, 31. The want of the due obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe rules, cauſeth many a hypocrite to promiſe himſelfe Peace, and many a Godly man to afflict his ſpirit, without ſufficient cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>third</hi> labour, after we have read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, muſt be to worke into our hearts, by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, thoſe things which we finde moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for our own uſe, ſo long till our affections begin to kindle, and our hearts to wax warme (as <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſtretched himſelfe often upon the <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namites</hi> child, till he firſt waxed warme, and then neeſed, and opened his eyes, 2 <hi>King</hi> 4.34.35.) So that our delight in thoſe divine and heavenly truths, and deſire after them, diſcover themſelves as they doe in holy <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.5.20, 40, 97, 103, 111, and 131, &amp;c. This is beſt done by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating them unto our ſelves, for that which affects us, is that which moſt neerely concernes us; without this meanes of quickening our hearts, they remaine dead and ſenſeleſs, and the Word becomes utterly unprofitable.</p>
                     <p>Againe, becauſe we are little affected with thoſe things which we beleeve not (as <hi>Iacob</hi> was with his ſons words, till he ſaw the Chariots, which aſſured him of the truth of what they affirmed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.26, 27.) our chiefeſt care muſt be, to bring our hearts to beleeve what we read, as undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, as <hi>David</hi> beleeves Gods Law to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.138. True from the beginning, <hi>ver.</hi> 160. truth it ſelfe, <hi>ver.</hi> 151. as being the word of that God that cannot lye, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. nor change his minde, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. nor be hindered in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108952:91"/>he purpoſeth to doe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.35. but he doth whatſoever he will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.6.</p>
                     <p>Withall,
<note place="margin">Our next care muſt be to work our hearts to a love of the law, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it.</note> we muſt labour earneſtly, to work our hearts to the love of thoſe Counſells of God, which we embrace by faith for their Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.128. Purity, <hi>ver.</hi> 140.

To this purpoſe, it will be needfull to ſet before us the wonderfull efficacy of the Word, which not only counſells, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.24. and directs us in our waies, <hi>v.</hi> 105. but helps us farther in clenſing them, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. in quickning the ſpirit, <hi>ver.</hi> 93. giving wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>v.</hi> 98, 99, 100. converting the ſoul, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.7. bringing great reward, that we obtained by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and great peace which they have that love them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.165.

                     <p>Such fervent affections,
<note place="margin">This will make us ſerious in deviſing how we may put the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of God in practiſe.</note> if they once quicken a mans ſpirit, cannot chooſe but move him to adviſe ſeriouſly with himſelfe, how he may bring both his heart and practiſe, to conforme to thoſe holy counſells and directions, which he finds laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in Gods Word, wherupon he muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily fall to the conſidering of his diſpoſition, condition, employments, and occaſions, and to

                     <p>A man having thus reſolved upon the practiſe of ſuch duties, as the Word preſcribes,
<note place="margin">For which end we are to take hold of the firſt Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</note> muſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the firſt opportunity offered unto him, to put his reſolution in execution. Partly, becauſe Opportunities are not alwaies preſented; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, becauſe the time of this life, which is allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the practiſe of the duties required, is ſhort, and the duties themſelves are many, wherein the more we abound the more we increaſe our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and further our account at the laſt day, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. And laſtly, becauſe the inlargement of the heart is requiſite to the running of the way of Gods Commandements, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 119.32. which therefore it will be needfull for us to make uſe of, when it comes upon us, knowing that we cannot command it when we will.</p>
                     <p>Now in ſetting to the Practiſe of ſuch duties, as the Word preſcribes, although we muſt have reſpect to all Gods Commandements, after <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>

<note place="margin">Eſpecially for thoſe duties which are layed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in Reading the Word.</note> 
                        <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 6.25. yet ſeeing all duties cannot be performed at once, we muſt take more ſpeciall care for the preſent, not only of thoſe things which our imployments in our particular callings, or incident occaſions preſs upon us, but of thoſe alſo which the Word which we have read or heard directs unto, conceiving that God thereby more eſpecially commends them unto us for that preſent.</p>
                     <p>We know, that we are not onely to do what God hath commanded,
<note place="margin">In all our Practiſe we muſt obſerve not only what is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but withall as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</note> but beſides to do it as he hath commanded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.25. without turning aſide to the right or left hand, <hi>verſe</hi> 32. that is, to perform the duties which God preſcribes, in ſuch Manner, Forme, and Order, as he requires them to be done. Wherefore, he that deſires to be accepted in his Obedience, ought to ſet the Word of God before him, as <hi>David</hi> doth his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 18.22. as a man doth the coppy by which he writes. This is done by keeping the rules, given us in the Word, freſh in our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, reviving them by often meditation. This uſe <hi>David</hi> made of the Word which he caryed alwaies with him as a Lanthorne, to direct him in every ſtep, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 119.105. having it ever with him, <hi>verſe</hi> 98. and having reſpect to his ſtatutes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, <hi>verſe</hi> 117.</p>
                     <p>Thus it behoves us to make uſe of the Word after we have read it.
<note place="margin">Examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our waies how neere they come up to the rule, or come ſhort of it.</note> But withall, becauſe we know the rules thereof are not only given for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but beſides for examination of our waies,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108952:92"/>it will be good for us, to call our ſelves daily to account, how our practiſe anſwers the rules, that are from time to time ſet before us in reading or hearing the Word. Both that on the one ſide, we may be incouraged in conforming our practiſe to the Law, and rejoyce in the grace of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in us, with thankfulneſſe;
<note place="margin">That wee may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or humbled.</note> and on the other ſide, when we find that we have ſwarved from the duty required, and the rule ſet before us, we may be humbled and grieved for our failings, and driven to ſeek unto Chriſt, to make up our peace, and may pray more earneſtly for Gods aſſiſtance, to look better to our waies for time to come, as <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.131, 132, 133, 176.</p>
                     <p>I make no queſtion, but that the conſideration of theſe directions, given for the profitable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Scriptures, will work diverſly upon divers perſons.
<note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>Obj.</hi> Such a ſtrict rule will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ſome, 1.

Some others, men of tender hearts, may, pondering all theſe duties in their thoughts, be driven to mourn in ſecret, when they find their own performances ſo unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the rules formerly delivered, and may doubt whether they are accepted or no.</p>
                     <p>To the former, I anſwer, that the ſame excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lies againſt all Gods commandements, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:108952:93"/>the ſuppoſed impoſſibility ariſeth eſpecially from the unwillingneſs of their own minds: and laſtly, the expence of time or labour is not ſo much as may well be ſpared from their vanities; or if an houre or more in a day be ſpared from labours, God can recompence it by his bleſſing, without which early riſing, and hard labouring, are to little purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.2. To the later ſort I ſay, that we come far ſhort of our duty in all our ſervices, that we deal with a gratious Father, who accepts us according to that we have if there be a willing mind, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. as requiring mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy rather then ſacrifice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.13. Only our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour muſt be, to do all things as perfectly as we can, and for that purpoſe the rule muſt be ſet downe in the exacteſt manner, which alſo ſerves beſt both to direct us, and to quicken our ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and beſides to ſtir us to thankfulneſs, for Gods gracious acceptance of our imperfect ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and pardon of our failings.</p>

                     <head>CAP. XII. <hi>Directions for the right interpretation of the Scriptures.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>NOt only the matters and ſubject which the Scriptures handle, being high and myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their nature, (which the Pſalmiſt calls <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Pſal.</hi> 119.18.) but beſides that, the phraſe &amp; manner of expreſſion, which is in many clauſes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:108952:93"/>far from vulgar or common uſe, make many things in Scripture hard to be underſtood, as the Apoſtle acknowledgeth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. wherefore, there is required much wiſdome and diligence in ſearching after the true ſenſe of Gods word, without which we cannot but erre dangerouſly in the grounds of our faith, and in the rules of practiſe. It will be therefore needfull to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us ſuch rules, as may help to direct us in fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out the true ſenſe of the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>But before we come to lay downe theſe rules, we muſt neceſſarily agree upon two concluſions. The <hi>firſt</hi> is acknowledged by all men without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, which is, <hi>That there can be no infallible interpreter of the Scriptures but God himſelfe.</hi> The <hi>ſecond,</hi> though it be ſomewhat more que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned then the former, yet is as true as it in all points, namely, <hi>That every Godly man hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him a ſpirituall light,</hi> by which he is directed in the underſtanding of Gods mind revealed in his word in all things needfull to ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the former of theſe two concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we muſt neceſſarily acknowledge, that ſeeing no man knows Gods mind but himſelf, as the Apoſtle affirmes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.34. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. therefore none can interpret his word, in places doubtfull,
<note place="margin">None can interpret Scriptures but God himſelfe.</note> but himſelf. For, ſeeing Gods mind cannot be otherwiſe known to us, then by the words wherein it is expreſſed, and when the words are ſuch as may import divers ſenſes, who can tell in which of thoſe ſenſes God uſed them, and would have them taken by us, but himſelf that uttered
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:108952:94"/>them, unleſſe ſome other perſon were privy to his thoughts?</p>
                     <p>As for the ſecond concluſion,
<note place="margin">Every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man hath a light in himſelfe to ſhew him the mind of God in his word.</note> that godly men have a light within their own breaſts, by which they are able to underſtand Gods meaning in his word, in things neceſſary to ſalvation, we know that God hath promiſed by his Prophet, <hi>that no man ſhall need to teach his neighbour, becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ſhall know him from the greateſt to the leaſt, Jer.</hi> 31.34. And the Apoſtle, <hi>that the anointing that they have abiding in them ſhall teach them all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27. the Anointing there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is <hi>that ſpirit which is given us of God, by which we know the things that are freely given us of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. by which every man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands ſpirituall things, as every man ſees and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers naturall things with his own eyes.</p>
                     <p>That every man ſhould have within himſelf ſuch a light or ſpirituall underſtanding,
<note place="margin">Which conduceth 1. To Gods honour.</note> as we have mentioned before, by which he may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and know the mind of God revealed in his word, conduceth much to Gods honour two waies.
<note place="margin">1. As ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</note> For <hi>firſt,</hi> God hath by this means as many witneſſes of his truth, as there are true believers, of whom every one knows what he ſpeaks, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.11. by his own underſtanding, and becomes thereby a more authenticall witneſs unto others, of that which he believes, upon a more certain ground, then if he had ſeen it with his own eyes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:108952:94"/>and cleerly, then he could poſſibly do by the helps of any other mans light, and finds his heart thereby more affected with thoſe glorious and holy truths which the Word reveals, underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the righteouſneſs and purity of that Word, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.138.140. which indeed is the only true means of admiring and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God for that holy word, in which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſuch glorious excellencies, that our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſouls are raviſhed with it, as <hi>Davids</hi> was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. upon the diſcovery of the ſweetneſſe thereof, <hi>verſ.</hi> 103.</p>
                     <p>Beſides,
<note place="margin">2. To our comfort when we ſee with our own eyes.</note> it is a ſingular comfort to every godly ſoul, to ſee with his own eyes. It's true, that it is a great comfort to a blind man, to meet with a faithfull guide, whom he may truſt to lead him on in his way: but it comes nothing neer the content, which a man that hath eyes takes when with them he ſees the way in which he walks. This diſcovery of the truth of God revealed in his word, is the only means of grounding our faith, preſerving us eſtabliſhed in the truth againſt errours, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie, and of filling our ſouls both with preſent comforts, and future hopes.
<note place="margin">This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward light may much be cleered and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by 1. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the word. 2. Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true that this inward light, or anointing (as Saint <hi>John</hi> calls it) may be much cleered and enlarged by ſuch helps as God is pleaſed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us, by the miniſtery of his word, by private conferences, and reading of godly mens wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which are therefore to be made uſe of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and conſtantly; and therefore they are juſtly to be ſuſpected, who rejecting them, brag of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:108952:95"/>I know not what inward light which they have received,
<note place="margin">3. And rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of godlymens books, which too many neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> which too often, by the event at leaſt, is diſcovered to be a ſeducing ſpirit of errour, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them from one phantaſie to an other, to the endangering of their own ſouls, and ſuch as cleave unto them. Theſe helps therefore, which we have mentioned, are not to be deſpiſed, nor yet any farther to be depended on, then as ſpectacles, ſerving to make things clearer unto the light which we have within us, which diſcovered them not ſo fully before.</p>
                     <p>To go on then,
<note place="margin">Rules for the finding out of the true ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> to the finding out, and laying down of thoſe rules, which muſt be followed for the finding out of the true ſenſe of the Scriptures, we muſt lay down, <hi>firſt,</hi> the foundation: That God intending in them, to reveal unto man his mind, muſt of neceſſity, if he would be underſtood, ſpeak unto them, after the manner of men, and therefore make uſe of ſuch words and phraſes, as men uſe to make their minds known by one to another. So that the firſt thing which we muſt look unto, in ſeeking out what God means to acquaint us with in his word, is to conſider what the expreſſions, which we meet withall, ſignifie in common uſe of ſpeech amongſt men. This we call the Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maticall ſenſe which they hold forth in their native and proper ſignification, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that which they ſignifie in common uſe of ſpeech, figuratively; as the womans ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. is her poſterity, and the ſerpents head, is the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents power. For ſeeing words ſignifie by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, they muſt be taken to ſignifie according
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108952:95"/>to mens intention, in common uſe of ſpeech, whether properly or figuratively.</p>
                     <p>This Grammaticall ſenſe may be found out by the Scriptures themſelves, foure waies. <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. To find out the Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ſenſe, 1. By com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</note> by comparing the Tranſlations with the originals; as where we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>He ſhall breake,</hi> there are that read it corruptly, <hi>She ſhall breake.</hi> Here the originall ſoon determines the controverſie, wherein the pronoune <hi>Hu,</hi> can ſignifie nothing but He, or It, both which are all one in effect in this place.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> means of finding the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by Scripture,

As 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Chriſt is the Saviour of all men;</hi> the word Saviour, muſt be interpreted in a generall ſenſe, for a preſerver or deliverer from evill or danger indefinitely, not a Saviour from everlaſting death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as after it ſignifies becauſe of the clauſe which follows, <hi>eſpecially of thoſe that beleeve,</hi> which implies that he is ſo a Saviour of thoſe which beleeve; namely, from everlaſting death and hel as he is not of all other men; ſeeing that in reſpect of everlaſting ſalvation, Chriſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is not the Saviour of any other, but only of his own body the Church, whereof he is the head,

                     <p>The <hi>third</hi> means to find out the true ſenſe of words in Scripture is the comparing of one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

Of theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſorts of Laws, that which we call Morall comes to be handled in the firſt place. Of theſe this which is called the morall Law (becauſe it was given by God for regulating of mens
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:108952:113"/>manners and converſation) is of all the reſt of the Laws moſt ancient,
<note place="margin">Which is the moſt ancient of all Laws,</note> moſt generall, and moſt perpetuall. Firſt, moſt ancient, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.160. as being given to our firſt Parents in Paradiſe,
<note place="margin">As given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</note> that is, to man aſſoone as he had any being. I grant indeed that we have no record of any other Laws given to <hi>Adam,</hi> but thoſe which we find mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. which are only ſome branches of the Second Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in the tree of life, of the Fourth in the Inſtitution of the Sabbath, of the Seventh in the Law of Marriage, and of the Eight in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing them to keep Paradiſe, which are all of them poſitive Laws, and therefore need to be expreſly ſet down, or elſe they could not have been known, whereas the reſt of the Laws, being all Lawes of nature, and therefore diſcernible by naturall right reaſon (for which cauſe they are ſaid to be written in mans heart) might be known although they were not recorded, and therefore are omitted by <hi>Moſes</hi> in that briefe hiſtory. But that the reſt of the morall Precepts were given unto <hi>Adam,</hi> although perhaps not by word of mouth,
<note place="margin">Either by word or written in his heart;</note> but written in his heart at the ſame time, muſt needs be granted, unleſſe we conceive that God made <hi>Adam</hi> more imperfect then any other of his creatures; for that he gave all the reſt of the creatures rules of their motions and operations either imprinted in their natures if they want ſenſe, or by the direction of ſenſe in thoſe that have it, is as cleare as the light. Now that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:108952:113"/>God ſhould either give no law, or (which is almoſt one) an imperfect law to man, who moſt needed, was moſt capable and beſt able to make uſe of a law, muſt needs much diſparage either his kindneſſe to mankind, or his wiſdome in rendring the moſt eminent and ſerviceable of all the creatures upon earth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſefull and unprofitable at the leaſt for moſt part if he had no perfect law to guide him.</p>
                        <p>It muſt therefore be neceſſarily granted that the whole morall Law was given to <hi>Adam</hi> (that is, to mankind) in Paradiſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                           <note place="margin">And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently moſt univerſall, as given to the whole nature of man in him.</note> and by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequent muſt be acknowledged to be of all laws the moſt ancient, and upon the ſame ground muſt neceſſarily be generall, or univerſall; ſeeing it was given in our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to the whole nature of man, which when that law was given was wholly in them. It is true, that the change of mans condition by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> fall hath ſeemed to cauſe ſome ſmall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the law, as it is not a duty that now binds us to labour in Paradiſe, or to abſtain from the one, or to eate of the other of the trees that ſtood in the midſt of it. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding even by that law all men in generall are bound to labour in ſuch employments as God cals them unto, and to abſtain from all things that God forbids, and to make uſe of all ſuch ordinances as the Lord appoints for the confirmation and ſtrengthening of their faith. So that thoſe laws given to <hi>Adam</hi> bind all men ſtill, in the grounds and ſcope of them,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:108952:114"/>although they oblige not his poſterity in thoſe things, which had relation to that ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he then ſtood, and from which afterwards he ſo ſodainly fell.</p>
                        <p>And upon the ſame ground,

<note place="margin">Upon the ſame ground thoſe morall lawes muſt needs be perpetuall,</note> that thoſe laws which were given to <hi>Adam,</hi> are perpetuall, to continue as long as men have a being on earth. For ſeeing they were given to him as the root of mankind, they neceſſarily bind his poſterity, in ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, to the end of the world. We never find any new law given to the Church in any age. It is true, that the law given to <hi>Adam</hi> hath been ſince renewed; perhaps to <hi>Noah,</hi> after the floud,
<note place="margin">Which have been renued,</note> (as may be probably gueſſed by that which we read concerning murther, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6.)

                        <p>That this which we call the Morall law,

                        <note place="margin">The firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was given to the whole nature of man in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                        </note> our <hi>firſt</hi> Argument ſhall be drawn from the Inſtitution of this day of holy Reſt, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon mans creation, recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. which upon the examining thereof, will appeare ſo ſtrong and cleare in it ſelfe, that it might be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convince any man, that is not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled before-hand by too much prejudice. And it may be thus framed. What Law ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was given to our firſt Parents in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning without relation to their preſent ſtate bindes all mankind to the worlds end. But ſuch was this Law of the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>It is true that there happened upon the fall of our firſt Parents, a change in the Law,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                        <note place="margin">Two changes of the Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> occaſioned by his fall.</note> which was given them by God in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The <hi>Firſt</hi> change happened to the whole Law, in reſpect of the conditions, and in part of the uſe of it. For whereas of man in the ſtate of innocency and perfection, full and perfect obedience to the whole Law was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:108952:120"/>
                        <note place="margin">1. In reſpect of the whole Law, perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereunto being then poſſible,</note> to be performed by him in his own Perſon, whereunto he was ſufficiently ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the perfection of his nature, in which he was created, but by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> that ability was ſo farre weakned, that ſuch obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was made impoſſible to him, or any of his poſterity after him:
<note place="margin">But by his fall made now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for us.</note> now in ſtead of our perſonall obedience, the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, who in our nature fulfilled the whole Law, is imputed to us for our juſtification, and our obedience is required, only as a fruit of that faith, by which we are juſtified. This makes ſo great a change in the Covenants made betweene God and man, before, and ſince the Fall, that they are uſually eſteemed to be two diverſe Covenants, the former before the Fall we call the Covenant of workes, and this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſince the Fall, we tearme the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> change which happened in the Law,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                        <note place="margin">2. In reſpect of ſome Laws gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Adam</hi> in reſpect of his condition ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then of his nature.</note> by occaſion of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſome duties commanded in the Law, the Sacramentall tree of life, and the whole uſe thereof, were of neceſſity taken away, becauſe the promiſe whereof that tree was the Seale was voide, by <hi>Adams</hi> breach of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to which it was annexed. And the charge of keeping, and dreſſing Paradiſe, was by like neceſſity utterly voide, when man for his rebellion was caſt out of that Garden. Other commandements, as thoſe concerning mans labour, and womens ſubjection to their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:108952:120"/>were made ſtraighter then they were before, but the ſubſtance of theſe Laws remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtill. And theſe changes happened only in ſuch particulars, as reſpected rather the ſtate of mans innocency in which he then ſtood, then the nature of man in generall; and are therefore excepted in the Major propoſition, wherein is aſſerted no more but that theſe laws are perpetuall, which were given to <hi>Adam</hi> as a man, not as to perfect man.</p>
                     <p>This propoſition thus underſtood is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon this ground of truth,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                        <note place="margin">God made his Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his nature, not to his perſon.</note> that God eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed his Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> principally in reſpect of his nature, and not ſo much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his perſon; ſo that by conſequent it muſt follow, that all who are partakers of that nature are bound by that Covenant. Of this faith we have an evident demonſtration, in the puniſhment which light upon the whole nature of man for <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, which of neceſſity ſuppoſeth the ſinne of mans whole nature, in <hi>Adams</hi> perſon, in whom it was then included: ſeeing otherwiſe we know the ſonne ſhall not beare the iniquity of the father, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.20. So that the argument holds ſtrongly and convincingly in this manner.
<note place="margin">As appeares becauſe the nature of man becomes guilty of the breach of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</note> If <hi>Adams</hi> breach of Covenant made between God and him, brought guilt upon all his poſterity, that is, upon the whole nature of man, then it muſt needs follow that the Covenant obliged the whole nature of man, it is utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that one ſhould become a guilty perſon by
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:108952:121"/>breach of a Covenant to which he was never bound. But the puniſhment inflicted upon the whole nature of man, makes it evident that the whole nature of man was made guilty by <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion; wherefore the whole nature of man was bound in the Covenant which God made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is obliged by the Law which was given in that Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Unto this argument,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                        <note place="margin">Secondly, Chriſt urgeth the Law of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage given in Paradiſe as then in force:</note> may be added another proofe taken from our Saviour Chriſts reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.48. about their queſtion concerning divorce, which they pretended to be permitted by <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.1, 2. For in diſputing with them our Saviour grounds his argument againſt the divorce pretended to be permitted by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe it croſſed that Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto <hi>Adam.</hi> So that all the ſtrength of our Saviours argument againſt their divorce muſt reſt upon this Maxime.
<note place="margin">Implying that the Law given in the beginn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</note> That which the Law given to <hi>Adam</hi> in the beginning did not allow, that ought not to be allowed: which is all one as if he had ſaid, that the Law given to <hi>Adam</hi> from the beginning is unalterable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remaines ſtill in full force, ſo that all men to the worlds end are bound to yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Some perhaps may object,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Objection. </seg>6</label> that this anſwer of our Saviour Chriſt unto the Phariſees is applied by him to that particular caſe alone, which was then propoſed, but extends not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:108952:121"/>farther, and therefore determines no more but that the law of marriage, which was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in the beginning, ſtands ſtill in force, but reſolves nothing concerning the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reſt of the Laws which were given to <hi>Adam</hi> at the ſame time, whether they be of force ſtill or no.
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                        </label> To which exception two things may be anſwered: <hi>Firſt,</hi> we ſay that ſeeing our Saviour reſolves that the divorce ſuppoſed to be permitted by the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is therefore not to be allowed, becauſe it was contrary to the law of marriage given by God to <hi>Adam</hi> in the beginning, then by all the rules of Logick and reaſon, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that whatſoever is contrary to any Law eſtabliſhed in the beginning muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, becauſe the reaſon of diſallowing that kind of divorce, is not drawn fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any thing that is peculiar to the Law of marriage, but from that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all the reſt of the Laws which were given at the ſame time, as well as to that particular, namely, that the Law given by God from the beginning did not permit it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> if our Saviours anſwer to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, wherein he condemnes the divorce pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be permitted by the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> be reſtrained to Marriage only, and extend not to the reſt of the Lawes given at the ſame time, it leaves unto the Phariſees a faire ground of exception againſt ſuch a reſolution of the queſtion propoſed. For they might eaſily have replied that this law was not in force any more
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:108952:122"/>then the reſt of the Laws given at the ſame time to our firſt Parents: now it is abſurd to imagine that our Saviour who knew their cavilling humours by experience, would leave them that ſtarting hole. Wherefore when he condemnes the divorce pretended to be permitted by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for that only reaſon becauſe it was contrary to the Law given to <hi>Adam</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, he muſt neceſſarily inferre that the Laws which were then given are ſtill in force, both unto us, and unto the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>The major propoſition of that ſyllogiſme that concludes the morality and perpetuity of the Sabbath (namely,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> that all laws given to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> which had reſpect to his nature, and not to his preſent condition, are morall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall) being thus fully cleared and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, there remains only the minor or ſecond propoſition to be made good, which conſiſts of two branches:
<note place="margin">Now the law of the Sabbath was given from the beginning.</note> The <hi>firſt</hi> that this law of the Sabbath was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe. The <hi>ſecond</hi> that it was given to him in reſpect of his nature, and not of his perſon; that is, to him as a man, not as an innocent or perfect man. Of theſe two branches, the oppoſers of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Sabbath, meddle not with the latter, but oppoſe only the former: affirming that the inſtitution of the Sabbath by God was not from the beginning. The reaſons of which oppoſition we ſhall examine after we have given our reaſons for the proving of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; namely, that the Sabbath was inſtituted
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:108952:122"/>by God from the beginning.</p>
                     <p>The diſpute concerning the day in which <hi>Adam</hi> fell, whether it was on the ſixth day on which he was created or on the next day; (which ſeems more probable if all things be duly weighed) as alſo of the time when the Sabbath day was firſt inſtituted, whether it was before <hi>Adams</hi> fall, while he was yet in Paradiſe; or after his fall, when he was driven out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; is not of any great moment to the point which we have in hand; (although ſeeing in the ſeries of the hiſtory written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> we find the giving of this, and diverſe other laws, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded before <hi>Adams</hi> fall, we have reaſon to think all things to have been done in the ſame order in which they are related; unleſſe we had better arguments then meer ſurmiſes to induce us to judge otherwiſe) it is enough to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe to have that acknowledged, which no man denies, that the law was given, while the whole nature of mankind was in our firſt Parents, upon that ground therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and granted by all, we thus argue.</p>
                     <p>That which <hi>Moſes</hi> relates God to have done,
<note place="margin">Proved by the ſeries of the hiſtory, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.</note> that he did in the manner and order that he relates: but <hi>Moſes</hi> relates that God inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Sabbath from the beginning, as well as marriage, and ſome other Laws: therefore it was ſo and then done. The words of <hi>Moſes</hi> his relation of the Inſtitution of that day of reſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. are theſe. And God bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it. Now that theſe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:108952:123"/>words Bleſſed, and Sanctified, in the moſt proper and ordinary conſtruction ſignifie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and annexed a bleſſing to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it, I conceive no man will denie. Wherefore ſeeing this is the moſt uſuall and proper ſignification of theſe words, and ſeeing no incongruity with other clauſes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the letter of that text, no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to any other place of Scripture, nor repugnancy to any principle of faith, enforce us to ſeeke out any other more unuſuall ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them, we have ſufficient warrant to conſtrue, and interpret them according to their uſuall, literall, and proper ſenſe in this place.</p>
                     <p>Now that Bleſſing and Sanctifying the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was from the beginning (beſides the ſeries of the hiſtory,
<note place="margin">And by the tearmes bleſſed and ſanctified,</note> which is a ſtronger &amp; more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing argument to prove that it was ſo, then any that is, or can be alleadged, to prove the contrary) may be evineed and farther made good by theſe reaſons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> we find the Lord himſelf in the fourth Commandment affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had bleſſed and ſanctified the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day (for ſo all the Interpreters render theſe words according to the moſt proper ſignification of them in the originall tongue) as remembring and referring unto an act done before the giving of the Law.
<note place="margin">Repeated in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and pointing at an act paſt.</note> Now we find in no place of Scripture, any mention of the Lords bleſſing, &amp; ſanctifying the Sabbath day, before the publiſhing of the Decalogue upon
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:108952:123"/>Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but in this only, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe thoſe that deny the Morality of the Sabbath, mention or ſuppoſe any time, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to the delivery of the Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> wherein God bleſſed and ſanctified the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, neither if any ſuch thing had been done by God, would the Scripture have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the recording of it, being a matter of ſo great importance; neither laſtly,
<note place="margin">3. Neither was any time ſo fit for giving this Law of the Sabbath as in the beginning:</note> was there any time ſo fit for the giving of this Law, as when the ground of the Inſtitution of this holy Reſt, which was Gods manifeſting of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the worlds creation by his reſting on that day, was new and freſh in memory.</p>
                     <p>This reaſon taken from the fitneſſe of the time for the enacting and publiſhing of this Law, carries with it the greater weight,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know how carefull God is to make every thing beautifull in its time, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.11. and conſequently, we have no reaſon to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that God would omit the fitteſt time for the giving of this Law, and defer it to a time leſſe ſeaſonable:
<note place="margin">As appeares in inſtituting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Feaſts.</note> eſpecially ſeing we ſee that in the Inſtitution of the Feaſts of leſſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> of leſſe frequent obſervation, and to laſt but for a time, he tooke care to ordaine them, when the mercies were yet freſh and new, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of the memory whereof they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. The ſame courſe the Church tooke afterwards, in the ordaining of the Feaſt of <hi>Purim,</hi> wherein both the occaſion and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:108952:124"/>of the Feaſt went both together. Nay even the Heathen themſelves by the very light of nature were directed to follow the ſame rule, as all men know.</p>
                     <p>But the ſtrongeſt and cleareſt argument to prove the Inſtitution of the Sabbath by God from the beginning,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> is the teſtimony of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
<note place="margin">The Apoſtle affirmes it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3, 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3.4. in theſe words. Although the works were finiſhed from the foundation of the world, for he ſpake in a certaine place (namely, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2.) of the ſeventh day on this wiſe. And God reſted the ſeventh day from all his workes. To ſhew the force of the argument, which is to be drawne out of this place, we muſt in this whole diſputation of the Apoſtle's, begun <hi>chap.</hi> 3.12. and ending, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.11. conſider what he chiefly aimes at, and intends to prove, which is to diſſwade men from unbeleefe; to which purpoſe he ſets before them the dangerous conſequents thereof, namely, that it excludes men out of heaven. To prove this he alleadgeth the teſtimony of the Prophet <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 95.11. who threatens the people of his time to be ſhut out of Gods reſt, as their Fathers by hardening their hearts through unbeleefe were ſhut out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> (a Type of heaven) if they proved unbeleevers, and hardened their hearts thereby, as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had done. If it ſhould be replied unto the Apoſtle, that <hi>David</hi> in that place alleadged out of the <hi>Pſal.</hi> meant not heaven by the reſt which he there mentions, the Apoſtle demonſtrates
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:108952:124"/>plainly that <hi>David</hi> in theſe words, which he relates, could not poſſibly by the name of Reſt, meane any thing elſe but the reſt of heaven.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle's argument by which he demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively proves,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> that the Prophet in the words which he cites out of him, could meane no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſt, but the reſt of heaven, is this in briefe. The reſt, which <hi>David</hi> mentions in that place, muſt needs be ſuch a reſt, as the men to whom he ſpeakes had not entred into; (for then it had beene a vaine thing, to threaten to ſhut them out of that, which they had already in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) but had a poſſibility to enter in it (or elſe it were a like folly to threaten that as a judgement upon them, to deprive them of that, which they ſhould never have any poſſibility to obtain.) But (ſaith the Apoſtle) there was no ſuch reſt to be entred into by them in <hi>Davids</hi> time, but only the reſt of heaven, therefore <hi>David</hi> in that place, cited by the Apoſtle, could meane no other reſt, but the reſt of heaven. To make good this argument he gives a ſufficient enumeration of all the kindes of reſts, which were poſſible to be meant by <hi>David,</hi> in the place alleadged, (which muſt all of them have this condition, that they might be entred into by men) which were three, the reſt of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, the reſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the reſt of heaven: into all which men had a poſſibility to enter. Now the reſt out of which they are threatned to be excluded, muſt be a reſt which they had not already entred into; But (ſaith our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle)
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:108952:125"/>into two of theſe Reſts men had entred before <hi>Davids</hi> time, into the reſt of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, from the foundation of the world, in which God reſted, after he had perfected his workes, and into the reſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in the daies of <hi>Ioſhua;</hi> therefore <hi>David</hi> could not threaten them to be excluded out of either of thoſe reſts; there could therefore be no other but the reſt of heaven, out of which they might be excluded, becauſe there was no other, but the reſt of heaven, to be entred into in <hi>Davids</hi> time, from which yet they might, and were in danger to be ſhut out by unbeleefe.</p>
                     <p>That the Reſt of the Sabbath was entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to from the foundation of the world, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle expreſly affirmes in theſe words, And God reſted the ſeventh day from all his works. But (ſay our oppoſits) the Apoſtle here affirmes no more, but that God entred into that Reſt of the ſeventh, or Sabbath day, but he ſpeakes not one word of mans entring into reſt on that day. Nowun to this we anſwer, that theſe particulars which follow cannot be denied. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the concluſion, which the Apoſtle intends to prove, is, that unbeleefe, ſhuts a man out of heaven. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is as manifeſt, that to prove this he produceth the Prophet <hi>Davids</hi> teſtimony, threatning men to be ſhut out of Gods Reſt, if they hardned their hearts by unbeleefe, as their Fathers had done. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is evident that the Apoſtle aſſumes, that <hi>David</hi> by this reſt could meane nothing elſe but heaven. <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:108952:125"/>it is as cleare, that he proves that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> by the Reſt which he mentions in that place, could meane no other Reſt but heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no other reſt left, out of which men might be excluded, but heaven, in <hi>Davids</hi> dayes. In the <hi>Fift</hi> place, to make that good the Apoſtle proceeds by way of enumeration or induction, and reckons up three ſeverall ſorts of Reſts, which might be called Gods Reſts, namely, the Reſt of the Sabbath, the reſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Reſt of heaven. <hi>Sixtly,</hi> the Apoſtle farther aſſumes, that the reſt which <hi>David</hi> mentions, could not be the reſt of the Sabbath, nor the reſt of <hi>Canaan. Seventhly,</hi> it cannot be denied, but that he affirmes that the people had many yeares, ages before <hi>Davids</hi> time, entred into <hi>Canaan,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Ioſhua.</hi> Every one of theſe particulars is ſo cleare in it ſelfe, that no man with any colour of reaſon can deny any of them. The queſtion is only, by what argument the Apoſtle proves, that by the Reſt mentioned by <hi>David,</hi> he could not meane the reſt of the Sabbath, for that only branch was left to be made good, to make up the full demonſtration of the concluſion, that the Apoſtle tooke on him to prove, that by that reſt, out of which <hi>David</hi> threatens them to be excluded by unbeleefe, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> could not mean <hi>Canaan,</hi> all men will acknowledge that the Apoſtle reaſons thus. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> could not threaten them to be ſhut out by unbeleefe, from that reſt which they had
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:108952:126"/>in their own poſſeſſion: but of the reſt of <hi>Canaan</hi> they had been poſſeſſed long before even from the dayes of <hi>Ioſhua.</hi> Now it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Apoſtle's hand to prove, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> by Gods reſt could not meane the Sabbath, he muſt of neceſſity take up the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which he had before proved, that he could not mean <hi>Canaan</hi> by Gods reſt, that is, becauſe they had entred into that reſt many yeares before. In like manner, if he will make good his argument, he muſt prove that <hi>David</hi> could not mean the reſt of the Sabbath, becauſe they had entred into that reſt long before. The oppoſites tell us, that the Apoſtles words can import no more, but that God entred into the reſt of the Sabbath, from the foundation of the world, but there is no mention made of mans entring into that reſt at that time. But how vain this exception is, we are now to ſhew.</p>
                     <p>If we underſtand theſe words <hi>Heb.</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> 4.4. only of Gods entring into his reſt on the ſeventh day, (as the letter of the Text at the firſt view ſeemes to carry it) the Apoſtles argument, if it be brought into form, muſt be thus framed. That reſt which was entred into already, could not be the reſt which <hi>David</hi> meant, becauſe he ſpeaks of a reſt yet to come: But the reſt of the Sabbath was entred into long before <hi>Davids</hi> time, even by God himſelfe, from the foundation of the world; Therefore the reſt of the Sabbath could not be the reſt that <hi>David</hi> meant in that place. I grant indeed
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:108952:126"/>that the concluſion neceſſarily follows out of theſe premiſes. But I affirm withall, that the major propoſition is utterly falſe, and no way futes with the ſcope of the Apoſtle in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. For it is true, that notwithſtanding Gods entring into the reſt of the Sabbath, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> could not mean that reſt in this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is poſſible, that men might not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that reſt, although God did, &amp; it is only mens entring into that reſt, that makes it impoſſible to be meant by <hi>David</hi> here, who ſpeaks of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding men from entring into that reſt which he there means, from which they could not be ſhut out, if they had entred already, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if they had entred into the reſt of the Sabbath before, <hi>David</hi> could not mean that reſt in that place. So then the oppoſition lies not between mens excluding, and Gods en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, both which might perhaps ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but between mans excluding and mans entring, upon which the whole weight of the diſputation lies, and that ſo evidently that it may be juſtly wondred, that any man that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to ſubmit to the truth, ſhould not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it. If therefore we frame the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor propoſition ſo, that it may ſute with the Apoſtles ſcope, which beſt interprets the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it muſt be compoſed in this form, or at leaſt to this purpoſe. That reſt into which the Jews had entred already, could not be the reſt out of which <hi>David</hi> threatens that they ſhould be excluded by unbeliefe. Whereunto if we
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:108952:127"/>adde this minor, or ſecond propoſition; But into the reſt of the Sabbath God had entred from the foundation of the world; there could follow no concluſion at all. But if we adde our minor propoſition, and ſo form our ſyllogiſme thus: That reſt, into which the Jews had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred from the beginning, cannot be the reſt, out of which thoſe that harden their hearts by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe, are threatned to be excluded: But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reſt of the Sabbath men had entred from the beginning: Therefore, the reſt of the Sabbath could not be that reſt out of which they are threatned to be excluded, that harden their hearts through unbeliefe: This conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion naturally and neceſſarily follows out of the premiſes, and fully ſutes with the whole courſe of the Apoſtles diſputation, and with the ſcope at which he aimes.</p>
                     <p>If there were no other Argument,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> but this which we have already produced, to prove thta the Apoſtle, although he names onely Gods reſting on the Sabbath day, yet muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily imply mans reſting on that day as wel as Gods, and that mans entring into the reſt of the Sabbath, ſutes moſt fully with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſcope, but Gods entring into that reſt makes nothing to his purpoſe, in this diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſſe it be to ſhew the ground of mans reſt at the ſame time; it might ſufficiently ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie any man that is willing to be guided by reaſon. Notwithſtanding as we have taken notice of the main drift, at which the Apoſtle
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:108952:127"/>aims in this diſputation, ſo it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe to conſider the grounds, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle laies, for the raiſing of his argument: To prove then, that <hi>David</hi> threatens unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to be ſhut out of heaven, which he here calls by the name of Gods reſt, he laies this for his ground, that this name of Gods reſt can be applied onely to three things, the Sabbath, <hi>Canaan,</hi> and Heaven. Now theſe three being all members under one generall head, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed one from another, muſt needs have ſomething common to them all, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing proper and peculiar, wherein they differ. That which is common to them all, is <hi>firſt,</hi> that they are Gods reſts, that is, reſts which God ordains for, and beſtowes upon men. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that they are therefore reſts into which men may enter. The difference between theſe reſts is, that two of them were poſſeſſed by men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and one of them was yet to come. Now the Prophet <hi>Davids</hi> words expreſly mention a reſt to come, and to conceive and affirm, that the Apoſtle building his argument upon this diſtinction, as it plainly appears he doth, ſhould impertinently intend to bring in Gods reſting in his own perſon, is to confound this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of reſts, which the Apoſtle lays for the ground of his Argument, and by conſequence his whole diſputation that is built thereupon.</p>
                     <p>To conclude,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> the Apoſtle not only laies downe a diſtinction of the ſeverall kinds of Gods reſts, in that diſpute, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. but farther
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108952:128"/>in applying it to his purpoſe inſiſts moſt ſtrongly upon the oppoſition between the words in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. and the words of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 45. by which he makes it manifeſt, that <hi>David</hi> could not mean that reſt of the Sabbath, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. For <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. thus he reaſons: <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of a reſt to come, but <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of a reſt paſt, therefore <hi>David</hi> cannot mean the reſt of the Sabbath of which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks, which was entred into ſo long before. And again, <hi>v.</hi> 5. he takes up the ſame oppoſition, in theſe words. And in this place (of <hi>David</hi>) again, If they ſhall enter: both in the 3. and 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> the Apoſtle inſiſts upon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> expreſſions [If they ſhall enter] which he ſhews cannot refer to the reſt of the Sabbath which was entred into (as <hi>Moſes</hi> relates) long before. Now wherein ſtands this oppoſition between the relation of <hi>Moſes</hi> that [God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted] the ſeventh day, &amp; <hi>Davids</hi> intermination [they ſhall not enter?] there is no oppoſition between theſe two expreſſions, God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and, They ſhall not enter, but between theſe two, They have entred, and, They ſhall not enter, there is a manifeſt oppoſition; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as therefore the Apoſtle preſſeth ſtrongly this oppoſition, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>ver.</hi> 5. it muſt be granted, that though he expreſſeth only Gods reſting on the ſeventh day, yet he ſpecially intends mans reſting, which was grounded thereupon.</p>
                     <p>Some amongſt the oppoſites grant that the Apoſtle may in the 3. &amp; 4. <hi>verſes</hi> of <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:108952:128"/>though he mention Gods reſting too, as being inſtituted and grounded upon Gods reſting upon the ſame day. But this (they ſay) was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only indirectly and by conſequence. Neither (ſay they) doth the Apoſtle limit Gods reſting, and mans reſting unto the ſame time, but mentions only Gods reſt, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from the foundation of the world, but not mans reſt, which began only from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering of the Law by <hi>Moſes.</hi> To this we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it muſt needs be that mans reſting is principally and directly intended in that place by the Apoſtle, although it be not expreſly mentioned, &amp; that Gods reſting is only named as the ground of the inſtitution of mans reſt: ſo that when he affirmeth that God reſted from the foundation of the world, he implies, that man reſted with him at the ſame time; ſeeing (as we have ſhewed) the whole weight of his Argument lies upon mans, and not upon Gods reſting. And when he affirms that man had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready entred into that reſt, it was fit for him to aſſigne the time when he entred into that reſt, as he doth afterwards ſet down the time when he entred into the reſt of <hi>Canaan:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the expreſſing of the time of entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that reſt, is that which gives moſt ſtrength to his Argument. Beſides, if mans reſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the giving of the Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> were meant by the Apoſtle, it was eaſie for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to have named that time, as it was to name the other.</p>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:108952:129"/>
                     <p>But what may be the reaſon (may ſome ſay) why the Apoſtle in this place, principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and meaning mans reſting on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, mentions notwithſtanding only Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting on the Sabbath day, but ſpeaks not a word of mans reſting on that day; and proves that out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2. when he might as eaſily have proved the other out of the <hi>verſe</hi> follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing? To this we anſwer, that the whole courſe of the Apoſtles diſpute, ſhews evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what he means. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we ſay that Gods reſt ſufficiently implies mans reſting at the ſame time, as being the very ground and foundation upon which the reſt of man on the Sabbath day was grounded. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> why the Holy Ghoſt was pleaſed rather to imply mans reſting on the Sabbath day, under the phraſe of Gods reſting, then to expreſſe in plainer tearms, we can no more give a reaſon, then we can tell why the ſame ſpirit of God ſets downe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers diſputations in ſuch broken expreſſions, that need the ſupply of many clauſes to make up the ſenſe cleer and full, or why in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture he ſhadows out many things, under obſcure phraſes, which might as eaſily have been expreſſed in clearer and plainer forms.</p>

<note place="margin">But what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation?</note> This reſting of God upon the ſeventh day, was the reaſon and ground of Gods ſanctifying and bleſſing the ſeventh day, in the Law which God gave unto his people, by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> upon mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> But firſt what incongruity with the ſcope of this place, or with any circumſtances of the Text, in which this is related; or with any other place of Scripture, or with any principle of faith, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth us to allow ſuch an anticipation in this place, as we are forced to admit in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places; becauſe we cannot otherwiſe find how they may agree, either the words with themſelves, or with ſome other place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without which neceſſity to admit antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations were to confound all order of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>For the countenancing of this anticipation,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> they ſay, that <hi>Moſes</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.) having mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Gods reſt (<hi>verſ.</hi> 2.) upon the ſeventh day, had thereupon a fit occaſion to point at the Law, which being given afterwards,
<note place="margin">It cannot be proved that the Law was given before <hi>Geneſis</hi> was written.</note> was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon that reſt of God, which is here rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. To which we anſwer; <hi>Firſt,</hi> this conceit ſuppoſeth, that which no man in the world
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:108952:131"/>ſhall be ever able to prove, that the book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> was written by <hi>Moſes</hi> after the giving of the Law (otherwiſe how could <hi>Moſes</hi> in this place give a reaſon of that Law which was not then in being?) but it ſeems more probable (if conjectures may have any place in reaſoning) that the book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> as it is placed firſt in order,
<note place="margin">The contrary ſeems more probable.</note> ſo was firſt written. For it is manifeſt by Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> words, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.25. that God had revealed himſelf to <hi>Moſes</hi> before he went out of the land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> into <hi>Midian,</hi> and had deſigned him to be the deliverer of his people. Again, that <hi>Moſes,</hi> during his abode in <hi>Midian,</hi> had leiſure enough to pen that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, it is evident in it ſelf. Laſtly, that the penning and reading of that hiſtory might be of ſingular uſe to ſtir up the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to go up out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> to take poſſeſſion of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> in which their Fathers had been ſo long a time ſojourners, and ſo bleſſed and advanced by God, that they were eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as Princes amongſt thoſe with whom they lived, eſpecially God having ſo freely and fully given that land to them and their poſterity, is ſo evident that no man can with any colour deny it. So that it muſt needs follow that in ſetling their anticipation upon ſuch a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition they build at the beſt upon a very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ground.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>

<note place="margin">1.

Honoring God, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do ones own waies, or to find his own pleaſure, or to ſpeake ones own words are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſuch an holy day of Reſt, as God delights in, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13. as well as publike worſhip. And the Fourth Commandement, which ſets apart an whole day unto the Lord entirely, and commands therein a totall ceſſation from all
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:108952:132"/>our employments in our ordinary calling, makes it evident. The ſequeſtring of our ſelves from our ordinary ſecular affaires for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duties is the full ſcope of that fourth Commandement, which if a ſingle perſon ſhut out by ſickneſſe, or any other caſuall accident from publike Aſſemblies perform, he keeps an acceptable Sabbath unto God, though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not joyne with the Congregation in the duties of publike worſhip.</p>

The fifth Commandement preſcribing the duties of Parents to their Children, is queſtionleſſe a Law of nature, ſhall we ſay that this Law was not at the leaſt written in <hi>Adams</hi> heart from the beginning, becauſe he had then no child?

                        </label> is, that then <hi>Adam</hi> needed no Sabbath, neither for his body, nor for his mind. For his body (they ſay) he needed no Sabbath, becauſe that he being exerciſed in no painfull or toylſome labour, but exerciſed only in ſuch work as might be accounted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a recreation then a labour, needed no reſt at all or refreſhing of his body thereby.
<note place="margin">1. Eaſe by reſt, though it be a conſequent, is not the ſcope of the Sabbath.</note> To this we anſwer, that the eaſe of man, and beaſt from labour, although it be a conſequent of the reſt of the Sabbath, yet was it never the ſcope of it, ſeeing the moderation of labour belongs properly to the ſame commandement, which enjoynes labour, that is, unto the Eight, as the Apoſtle alſo interprets it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. The Fourth Commandement forbids labour indeed, but not ſo much for mercy, as for Piety, nor ſo much for eaſing of the toyle of the body, as for the preventing of the diſtraction of the mind by labour, ſeeing we know the body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not labour, but the mind muſt needs be more or leſſe employed withall, which therefore at that time cannot ſo freely be wholly exerciſed in Spirituall duties, as it ought. So that <hi>Adam</hi> might have uſe of a Sabbath in Paradiſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he needed it not for the eaſe of his body.
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Adam</hi> might make uſe of the Sabbath in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his minde.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, but (ſay they) <hi>Adam</hi> much leſſe needed a Sabbath in reſpect of his mind, then he did
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:108952:133"/>in reſpect of his bodie, becauſe his mind in that ſtate of Innocency being continually fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with heavenly thoughts, he could not chooſe but keep a perpetuall Sabbath. To this Objection we have anſwered in part already, that the Sabbath requires of us not only the filling of the mind with heavenly Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but beſides a totall ſequeſtration of the whole man to the exerciſe of all holy duties; forbidding us to finde our own pleaſure, or our own waies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13. that is, take up any employment either of body, or minde, about any of thoſe affaires which may properly becal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our own, ſuch as are all our ſecular affaires. Now although <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe had not in that eaſe and pleaſure of his in keeping the Garden, his minde ſo wholly taken up with that buſineſſe, as ours are now in our more toyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome works; yet it muſt needs be and was his duty too to attend, and to have his minde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the thoughts of thoſe things that he tooke in hand, which on the Sabbath ought to be wholly laid aſide. In one word, <hi>Adam</hi> was and ought on other dayes to be wholly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly minded in the uſe of earthly things, but on the Sabbath day, he was to be wholly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly minded in the uſe of heavenly things.</p>
                     <p>All then that can be made good in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is only this,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> that <hi>Adam</hi> in ſome reſpects leſſe needed a Sabbath then we doe, whence cannot poſſibly be inferred that he therefore needed none at all; nay, upon the ſame ground
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:108952:134"/>it will follow, that becauſe he being riper in knowledge, ſtronger in faith, and more quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fervent in affection, leſſe needed the Sacraments, or other like helps as we doe, it was not fit for him to have any Sacrament at all.
<note place="margin">As well as of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.</note> Rather we may conclude, that becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> infinitely excelled us in all theſe abilities, therefore, though he leſſe needed, yet he was more fit to keep a Sabbath then we are, having more leiſure, and being more heavenly minded then we are. All this while we ſpeake of the Sabbath as if it were given to man only for his own good, whereas the principall ſcope of it is the honouring of God, which was <hi>Adam</hi> duty as well as ours: So that in reſpect of the principall end of the Sabbath <hi>Adam</hi> needed that Law for the obſervation thereof, as well as we.</p>

                        </label> then had the Patriarchs been bound to the obſervation of it, and had certainly obſerved it. Now that the Patriarchs did not obſerve it, it is evident (ſay they) becauſe we find no mention, upon record, of the obſervation thereof by any of them either before, or after the Flood, till <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. immediately before the giving of the Law. We anſwer, that if they can make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that none of the Patriarchs did obſerve the Sabbath, we will be willing to grant them that they had no Law that bound them to any ſuch obſervation: But it will be a very hard
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:108952:134"/>matter to make that appeare by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing argument. Yes, (ſay they) if they had obſerved it there would have been left ſome record of it by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who wrote their lives; as (ſay they) he hath left us inſtances of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of the other Nine Commandements, but for their obſervation of the Sabbath day he makes not ſo much as the leaſt mention at all. To this we anſwer divers things. <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1.

                        <note place="margin">For 550 years after <hi>Moſes</hi> we have no record of keeping the Sabbath.</note> the two books of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and the firſt booke of <hi>Kings,</hi> (containing the hiſtory of the Church, for 550. yeares, and written much more largely then the books of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>Exodus</hi>) we finde not upon record ſo much as the very name of the Sabbath; ſhall we therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from thence that the holy men of thoſe times, eſpecially <hi>Ioſhua, Samuel,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> kept not the Sabbath, when we know they had a Law that bound them thereunto? and yet we have inſtances enough out of the ſame books of their keeping of the other nine Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:108952:135"/>we are ſure that they had a Law, that bound them to keep it, but the Patriarchs had no ſuch law; this I ſay is no juſt exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt our inſtance, for it is to beg the point in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

It is not certaine, (though we prove it is) or at leaſt not ſo certaine that the Patriarchs had a Law that bound them to keep the Sabbath, therefore it is certaine that they kept it not.

But hereunto they will reply, that the performing of this publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip proves not the obſervation of the Sabbath, or ſeventh day for that worſhip. To which we anſwer: that uſing of publike worſhip neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuppoſeth a time, a fit time, and a time of Reſt for that worſhip, for ſo much themſelves acknowledg to be of the Law of Nature,

<note place="margin">2.

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:108952:136"/>Beſides, the Lord by <hi>Moſes</hi> rebuking thoſe that contrary to Gods Commandement went out to ſeek food on the Sabbath day, expreſſeth himſelfe to them in this manner: How long will ye refuſe to keep my Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and my Laws? implying that this was a continued breach of the Sabbath, as well as of other Laws of God. By all thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances laid together, and duely weighed, it will appeare that the obſervation of the Reſt of the Sabbath, was well known to the Church of God, by a long continued Law, delivered from hand to hand to poſterity, although in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time, much diſuſed and neglected by men in the courſe of their practiſe, eſpecially in the Aegyptian bondage.</p>

                     <p>Again,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> for three reaſons we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that in this <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. there is any inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Sabbath at all. For, <hi>firſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2.

                     <p>IF this principle (which will at laſt appear to be an undoubted truth) were generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and acknowledged, that the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue is morall, and conſequently immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; this queſtion concerning the morality of the Sabbath were at an end.

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:108952:140"/>(but without any firm ground, either out of reaſon, or Scripture) that it muſt needs be granted, that there is ſomething ceremoniall in the fourth Commandement, either the ſet day, or the ſtrict reſt of the Sabbath, or both, hath been a great occaſion of begetting and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing this errour, that there is ſomething mutable in the Decalogue, and conſequently that it is neither morall nor perpetuall. If therefore upon a due and thorough examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the ſeverall clauſes and expreſſions which we meet with in the fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, we can make it appear that there is nothing in that fourth Commandement that is any way ceremoniall, and therefore mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; we ſhall remove a great ſcruple which hath long troubled the minds of many men, divers of them much eſteemed both for their learning and piety.</p>
                     <p>Before we begin to take this task in hand,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it will be needfull to premiſe this one thing by way of caution, That in this caſe we are not bound to prove that the phraſes and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which we meet withall in this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
<note place="margin">The words of of the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a fair conſtruction enjoyn no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall neither in the day nor reſt:</note> can have no other ſenſe then that in which we take them. It will be ſufficient for us to make it appear that according to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall courſe of grammaticall conſtruction, and without any incoherence or incongruity with other parts of the law, they may be taken in ſuch a ſenſe as we give them. For if we can but make this appear, that our conſtruction of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:108952:140"/>the words is as fair and proper as any other that is given by others, the conſequent of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the immutability of the Decalogue is of that weight, that I conceive any man of two probable interpretations will be willing to embrace that which moſt makes for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of the morall law.
<note place="margin">Which is as much as needs to be proved.</note> It muſt therefore be our care to make it appear that the ſenſe, which we give of the words of this law, may ſtand according to a fair and uſuall manner of grammaticall conſtruction, and thoſe that will oppoſe us, muſt prove on the other ſide that it cannot ſtand.</p>
                     <p>That we may proceed methodically in the interpretation of the Commandement,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> we muſt, <hi>firſt,</hi> enquire what the ſcope is at which it aimes.
<note place="margin">The appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a day of reſt cannot be the ſcope of the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> For all Laws being rules directed to ſome end propoſed, cannot ſo well be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted any way, as by the end unto which they are directed. Now the appointing of a day of reſt, cannot poſſibly be the laſt ſcope of this Commandement, ſeeing we know reſt from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is enjoyned to give us freedome for holy duties, and the exerciſing of our ſelves therein,
<note place="margin">But of reſt for holy duties,</note> which conſequently muſt be the principall thing intended in the fourth Commandement. But then it will be queſtioned, to what kind of holy duties this day is conſecrated. For there are many that imagine that God hath ſet it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part only for duties of publike worſhip.
<note place="margin">Publick and private.</note> But this opinion ſeemes not to agree with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Law, which in expreſſe tearms gives
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:108952:141"/>the whole day unto the Lord, for his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſervice in religious worſhip. Now we know publike worſhip takes not up the whole day. It muſt needs be granted therefore, the Lord appointed that day of holy reſt for the performance of ſomething more unto God then publike worſhip, and ſo much is expreſly affirmed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13. where we are forbidden to find our own pleaſure, or ſpeak our own words upon that day, which, as all men muſt acknowledge, muſt needs extend to the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our carriage in private, as well as in publike, ſo that the ſetting apart of a whole day of reſt unto God, for his publike, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate worſhip, ſeemes to be the full ſcope of this fourth Commandement.</p>

                        <note place="margin">3 Parts of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, the 1. Summe. 2. Explication. 3. Reaſon.</note> we are to conſider adviſedly the frame and compoſure of it, and therein we are firſt to take notice of the principall parts of the Law, which we ſhall find to be three. <hi>Firſt,</hi> we have laid down unto us the ſumme of the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.8: <hi>Secondly,</hi> we have the explication of that ſum, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we have the reaſon of all, <hi>v.</hi> 11. Each of theſe two firſt parts containe three heads of duties pointed out in the ſumme, and opened and unfolded in the explication, and confirmed in the reaſon of the Law. The <hi>firſt</hi> duty is Preparation, intimated in the word Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member: The <hi>ſecond,</hi> the Sequeſtration from ordinary employments, implied in the word Sabbath. The <hi>third</hi> is, Sanctification of that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:108952:141"/>reſt, expreſſed in the phraſe, to keepe it holy. All theſe are explained in their order. Our Preparation muſt be by the diſpatch of all our Secular affaires in ſix daies: Our reſt muſt be a ceſſation by all perſons from our uſuall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and imployments in ſecular affaires. The Sanctification of our reſt, muſt be by employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves in holy duties. The confirmation of all follows in the reaſon of the Law; of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and reſt from Gods own Act of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the world in ſixe daies, and ceaſing from his work on the ſeventh, and the Sanctifying of that reſt from Gods Commandement, and ordaining the ſeventh day to be a day of reſt unto us for ever. Now wherein the ſtrength of that Confirmation lies, will be the maine point in queſtion, of which hereafter.</p>
                     <p>To come now to the Explication of the words and phraſes in this Commandement.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The firſt word in the ſumme of this Law, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, is diverſly interpreted, ſome conceive that it implies the importance of the duty commanded, as that word is uſed many times to intimate ſome matter of ſpeciall obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.7. Others there are that think it points at the Antiquity of that Law, given ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages before, and therefore to be called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh to minde, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the works of the Lord, his wonders of old, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 177.11. and 143.5. and withall ſome conceive that he taxeth the peoples forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that Law, and neglect of the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:108952:142"/>of it in the time of their bondage in Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt. Some or all of theſe ſenſes may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in this word Remember, but beyond all theſe we may probably conceive that it may import.
<note place="margin">Remember im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies [Think upon, and by diſpatching of thy buſines, provide for the Sabbath]</note> Think upon, and accordingly before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand provide for the obſervation of this holy reſt by diſpatching of all the works of thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that nothing may be undone, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and diligence might prevent, that might hinder thy reſt on the ſeventh day. As for thoſe which conceive that in this Law la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour upon the ſixe daies is commanded, as well as reſt upon the ſeventh, they are much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The precept for labour is delivered in the eight Commandement, as the Apoſtle inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets that Law, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. In this place is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the diſpatch of our ſecular affaires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sabbath, whether it be done in ſix daies or fewer it is not materiall, as to this Law.</p>
                     <p>The next tearme to be explained,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
                        <note place="margin">Sabbath is a day of reſt, which only, and not ſeventh, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in ſum and concluſion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> is the name of the Sabbath or day of reſt, and eaſing from labour, (as that word properly ſignifies) which is repeated againe in the concluſion of the Commandement. And it is not to be paſſed by without obſervation, that whereas the old Sabbath from the beginning till Chriſt came was the ſeventh day, or laſt of the weeke, and both in the explanation, and reaſon of the Commandement is appointed to be one of the ſeven, yet God mentions not the name of ſeven either in the Summe or in the Concluſion of the Commandement. We have therefore
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:108952:142"/>reaſon to conceive that ſeeing God in this Law was to preſcribe ſomething of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<note place="margin">The day of reſt being of the law of nature, &amp; the ſet day of poſitive inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</note> which is the appointing of a day of holy Reſt to be conſecrated unto God for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which the very light of nature teacheth, and in the explanation and reaſon of the Law, to adde ſomething which is of poſitive Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, the proportion of the time, and the ſet day wherein this reſt was to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he firſt ſettles that which is of the Law of nature, and afterwards eſtabliſheth that which is Poſitive. God purpoſely makes choiſe of ſuch fit expreſſions (eſpecially in his Law, in which he is moſt exact) as may beſt acquaint us with his minde. Wherefore ſeeing this is a fit Method to be obſerved by him, and ſeeing the compoſure of this Law agrees with it, we have reaſon to conclude that the Lord himſelfe intended it in this place.</p>
                     <p>The laſt phraſe in the ſum of this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remains, which is, To keep it holy.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
                        <note place="margin">To keep holy, is to employ the day in holy duties of Gods immediate worſhip.</note> Now to keep a day holy, is to employ it in holy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, directed to the immediate ſervice and worſhip of God in the uſe of ſuch ordinances as he hath left unto his Church, and to paſſe our time therein in holy ſpeeches and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Actions may be holy, either in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing them, as when we performe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties either to God or men in obedience to Gods will, in a reverend and holy fear of his name, in thankfulneſſe for mercies received, and for the advancement of his glory, which
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:108952:143"/>ought to be our maine ſcope in all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. And ſo we are redeemed out of the hands of our enemies, that we might ſerve him in holineſſe all the daies of our lives: as <hi>Zachary</hi> tels us, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.75. which reacheth to all our ways and actions.

Theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or the moſt part of them muſt have a place in our daily employments, but muſt be ſo our whole work upon the Sabbath day, as the works of our ordinary callings ought to be on the other ſix days.</p>
                     <p>This then is the brief ſum of the law:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> after which there follows a larger explication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, deſcribing more fully and cleerly what God means by that day which he calls the Sabbath, what manner of reſt it muſt be, and within what compaſſe and revolution of time it muſt be obſerved;
<note place="margin">In the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is aſſigned the proportion of time for this reſt, a day of ſeven.</note> namely, that it muſt be one day in ſeven, or one day in every weeke. And in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting and aſſigning of that proportion of time, that he may ſhew unto us at once, not only the meaning, but alſo the equity of this Law, he makes a diſtribution of the week into ſeven parts, whereof he allowes unto us ſixe for our ordinary labours and employments in our ſeverall callings, and contents himſelfe with the ſeventh day only, which he appoints to be a day of holy reſt for his owne immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate worſhip, which is notwithſtanding not a
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:108952:143"/>day loſt unto us, but indeed a day of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, a day of thriving in grace, and a day of enjoying an holy Communion with our God, and rejoycing in him; a day of enjoying hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon earth, if it be obſerved as it ought to be.</p>
                     <p>To take up the words themſelves in order as they lie before us,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
                        <note place="margin">Sixe daies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whether the ſixe firſt, or laſt, is not expreſſed.</note> it followes [ſixe daies ſhalt thou labour,] which ſixe daies thoſe daies of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhall be he expreſſeth not, whether the ſixe firſt, or the ſixe laſt, but ſpeaking indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely he leaves the words to be underſtood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely: Queſtionleſſe the maine thing that he preſcribes in this explication is the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time to be ſet apart for this holy reſt, the order to be obſerved therein he ſets down afterwards, in the reaſon of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein he leaves a rule to direct us which of the ſeven daies we are to ſet apart for this holy reſt: But in this explication the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt thing that God ſets before us is the equity of reſerving this proportion of time, that is,
<note place="margin">In this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time the equity of the Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares.</note> one day of ſeven, for his own worſhip, which will be ſufficient for that uſe, and yet lea ves ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time for the diſpatch of our own affaires.
<note place="margin">Day here is a naturall day, ſuch as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſixe are.</note> By a Day he means a naturall day conſiſting of foure and twenty houres, which is the ſeventh part of the week. Shalt, is as much as Maieſt, a word rather of permiſſion then command; God in this place having no purpoſe to order any thing concerning our ſecular affaires far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then they have relation to his own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:108952:144"/>and to the making way for the better obſervation of this holy day of reſt.</p>
                     <p>It follows,

<note place="margin">Doe all thy work, is, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch thy work that thou maiſt be free to keep the Sabbath.</note> lies the force of a command, but that command is not ſo much to require us to labour, as by labour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch all the buſineſſe of our ſecular employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, leaving no needfull thing undone, that by care and diligence might have been fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the ſixe daies precedent, the neglect whereof might be an occaſion of violating the reſt of the Sabbath.
<note place="margin">Our works are the works of our ſecular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, excluding buſineſſes which our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings lay not upon us.</note> By all our work he meanes all the work that our particular callings lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, in which God hath placed us, and which alone are properly called our own works.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> in the next place takes order for his own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in the words following. But the ſeventh day, &amp;c.

In this argument the naming of the place where, and the fire in which God appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his people, only fill up the narration, the whole force of the argument lies in this, that becauſe they ſaw no ſimilitude, therefore they ſhould make none:
<note place="margin">So it is in Gods mentioning his Reſt on the ſeventh day.</note> In this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement which we have before us, Gods manifeſting of the perfecting of the worlds Creation by his reſting on the ſeventh day, could not be clearly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:108952:146"/>without mentioning the day in which he reſted, which was indeed the ſeventh day from the Creation, but the Lord proves nothing from the order but from the proportion of the time wherein he reſted. In arguing, the tearms of the proporſion to be proved, muſt (where there is any Ambiguity) interpret the tearmes of the argument, becauſe the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is brought for the proporſition to be proved, not the propoſition for the argument. The propoſition to be proved then being that one day in ſeven muſt be conſecrated unto God, and the arguments brought to prove it, being taken from Gods reſting one day in ſeven: although that happened to be the laſt of the ſeven daies, yet the proportion of the time of reſt, being the only thing intended to be proved, is the only thing to be reſpected both in the argument, and in the tearms where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is expreſſed. So then hitherto we ſee no reaſon why the tearme Seventh in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Commandement may not be taken indefinitely for one in ſeven, as well as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and ſtrictly for the laſt in ſeven.</p>
                     <p>Yea,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> if all circumſtances be duly weighed, the taking of the tearme Seventh indefinitely beſt ſutes with the principall ſcope which God aimes at in this Law, and with the coherence of the Text. The ſtrongeſt of thoſe arguments which evince this truth it will be moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to forbeare till hereafter. In the meane time we may take notice of this by the way,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:108952:146"/>that the very clauſe precedent to theſe words directs us to take the tearme Seventh in this place indefinitely,
<note place="margin">The allowing of ſixe daies for labour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects to take the ſeventh indefinitely.</note> as pointing only at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and not all at the order of the time, wherein we are to reſt. <hi>Firſt,</hi> this is evident and unqueſtionable, that God dividing the whole week into ſeven parts, allowes unto us ſixe daies for the diſpatch of our buſineſſe in our ſecular affaires, and reſerves the ſeventh for himſelfe for his own worſhip. In the <hi>next</hi> place it is as cleare, that as the ſixe daies allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for labour are to be taken, ſo we muſt take the ſeventh which is ſet apart for this holy Reſt. Now that theſe ſixe daies allowed unto us for our labour are to be taken indefinitely, and to be reſpected only according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the time, I conceive no man with any colour of reaſon can deny, ſeeing the maine thing that God inſiſts on, and labours to cleare unto us, is, that ſixe daies are ſufficient for the diſpatch of our ſecular affaires. Now if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time be all that God reſpects in the ſixe daies of labour, then the proportion of time muſt needs be all that God can intend in the ſeventh day, which he ſets apart for a day of reſt.</p>
                     <p>The next clauſe in the Law followes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> Is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, that is,
<note place="margin">Sabbath of the Lord thy God; that is, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to him.</note> a day of holy reſt conſecrated to the Lord thy God. Now things are ſaid to be Gods for the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar intereſt that he hath in them, whether by Creation, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.3. He made us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:108952:147"/>wee are his people; By redemption or purchaſe, ſo the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> God chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth to be his own, becauſe he had bought them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.1. By deputation or deſignation, as Chriſt is called Gods king, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. and <hi>David</hi> a Type of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19, 20. Or by advancing or honouring, ſo a day may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods, becauſe he hath advanced or honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it above other daies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.24. Or laſtly, by conſecration and dedication to God; ſo the Prieſts are the Lords, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.26. the tythes, veſſels, &amp;c. the Lords, for his ſervice. Now in both theſe latter reſpects, the day of holy reſt is the Lords day, as he calls it, his Sabbath, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13. Both becauſe his works have advanced that above any other day; and beſides, becauſe upon that ground it is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to him and ſet apart for his ſervice.

                     <p>This foundation being laid,

If there were any ſtricter reſt then this enjoyned the Jews, (which perhaps will not ſo eaſily be proved) it is not required by any reſtraint in this Commandement, and therefore not exacted upon us Chriſtians. As for the forbidding of the kindling of a fire, and dreſſing of meat, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.5.13. &amp; 35.3. they were inhibitions which determined (as it is moſt probable) with the Iſraelites peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the wilderneſſe, and laid upon them by other laws; ſo that hitherto we meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ceremoniall in this fourth law.</p>
                     <p>The laſt main branch of this law is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or confirmation of it.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/>
                        <note place="margin">No reaſon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to any law but only to this fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> But before we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the opening of the phraſes and tearms in which it is penned, we cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of one thing by the way, that we find no reaſon annexed to any other Commandement of the Decalogue but to this alone. We find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome Sanctions annexed to the ſecond, third, and fift Commandements, but none ſave this fourth is confirmed by a reaſon. The cauſe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:108952:148"/>hereof can be no other but this, becauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the duties commanded in other laws are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laws of nature, or at leaſt approvable by naturall reaſon as ſoon as they are delivered,
<note place="margin">Becauſe the grounds of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laws are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but the ground of this law could not be known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it had been revealed.</note> becauſe the grounds upon which thoſe lawes are founded, are evident in themſelves; the grounds of this fourth Commandement could not have been known, unleſſe they had been revealed by God himſelf. Indeed that God muſt be publikely worſhipped, That a ſet time muſt be appointed, and that it muſt be a time of reſt from private employments, are dictates of naturall reaſon. But why we muſt obſerve a weekly Sabbath and not a monthly, and why the ſeventh or firſt day of the week rather then the third or fourth, no man could have found out the reaſon unleſſe God had revealed unto us the Creation of the world in ſix daies and his reſting upon the ſeventh, by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof the equity of this law clearly and manifeſtly appears, and upon the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation thereof is as eaſily approved and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto even by the light of naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>So then the reaſon alledged in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement ſhews us not why God ordained a Sabbath,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> (which the very light of nature taught even the very heathen, as we know) but why he commands a weekly Sabbath, and why upon ſuch a day of the week rather then upon any other. That therefore which we are to ſearch after in the examining of this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:108952:148"/>is, how the equity of theſe two particulars is diſcovered therein, that we may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this Commandement alſo to be juſt and good, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of all the reſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. yea equall and right concerning all things, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.128. and thereupon ſubmit unto it, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, but by a willing mind, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. Now concerning the former of thoſe two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, why God allots out ſuch a proportion of time, as one day weekly for his Sabbath, we have already in a great part diſcovered the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity thereof in the explication of this law, wherein it appears that ſo much time may be ſpared, without prejudice to our particular callings, which if it ſhould be denied, God makes farther manifeſt by this reaſon annexed, which we have before us.</p>
                     <p>To make it appear that ſix daies in the week are ſufficient for the diſpatch of our ſecular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, one ground muſt be ſuppoſed,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
                        <note place="margin">Why we may ſpare one day of ſeven for this holy reſt.</note> which is unqueſtionable, that mens labours about the things of this world, are onely for the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the creatures, and fitting of them for mans uſe. That ground being laid, this reaſon for the ſtrengthning of our faith laies before us the example of God himſelf, who created the world and all things therein in ſix daies: from whence we may ſtrongly reaſon, that he that without the help of mans labour, created the world in ſix daies, can eaſily by mans labour of ſix daies ſupport and conſerve the world.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:108952:149"/>If it be queſtioned whether he will do it; reaſon will eaſily conclude, that the ſame goodneſſe that moved God to give a being to things that were not, will much more move him to conſerve and provide for the things that are, being all the work of his own hand, ſeeing we know him to be a faithfull Creator, as the Apoſtle calls him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we find that the godly for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their faith, and dependence on God upon any incident occaſion, uſually have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the creation of the world, as the means to aſſure themſelves of his protection, or ſupply in any thing that they need, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.73. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.22. unto which God himſelf directs us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.11, 12. Our help ſtands in the name of the Lord which hath made heaven and earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.2.</p>
                     <p>The Lord having made it appear that the conſecrating of a day weekly unto God for his worſhip,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> will be no prejudice to our ſecular affairs,
<note place="margin">Why we muſt obſerve ſuch a particular day.</note> gives us next a reaſon, why he makes choice of the ſeventh day rather then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be this day of holy reſt, even becauſe himſelf reſted from all his works of creation upon that day. Now that this reſt of God is the ground of appointing this to be the day of reſt, all men acknowledge, but how the reaſon muſt be drawn out from this ground, and wherein the force of it conſiſts, is all the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: For whereas in Gods reſt there is a double conſideration, the one of the act it ſelf
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:108952:149"/>ſimply, the very reſting of God from his work, the ſecond of the conſequent of it,
<note place="margin">
                           <p>If we draw the reaſon from Gods act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, it muſt be the ſeventh day.</p>
                           <p>If from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of that day thereby, it enforceth the obſervation of the firſt day as well as of the ſeventh.</p>
                        </note> the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and honouring of that day above other daies thereby: If we draw the reaſon of the inſtituting of this day from Gods ſimple act, it neceſſarily inforceth the obſervation of that very ſeventh day from the creation after Gods example: But if we draw it from the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of his reſt, the advancing and honouring of that day thereby, it binds us as well to the obſervation of the firſt day of the week now, as it did the Jews to the obſervation of the ſeventh day heretofore.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that oppoſe the morality of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> labour to draw the reaſon which is laid down in this fourth Commandement, for the obſerving of this day of reſt,
<note place="margin">Wee cannot make Gods act of reſting the ground of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting the Sabbath.</note> from Gods bare act of reſting himſelf upon that day: which if they do, they muſt form their argument in this manner, That day in which God himſelf reſted from his works, he appointed to be a day of mens reſting from their works: but that was the ſeventh or laſt day of the week: therefore God ordained that to be the day on which men ſhould reſt from their works. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the argument framed in this manner there lie two main exceptions;
<note place="margin">1. Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is not the ground of any Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> the <hi>firſt</hi> of them is, the example of God neither is, nor can be any warrant to us to do the like, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we ever find it propoſed unto us as a rule which we muſt follow.

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:108952:150"/>ſometimes as incitements to ſtir us up to the performance of ſuch duties as are required of us by the law, as <hi>Luke</hi> 6.36. Be mercifull as your heavenly father is mercifull, and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5. Let this mind be in you which was alſo in Chriſt: but we never find any act of Gods or of Chriſts propoſed unto us as a rule to teach us what we ſhould do.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> that the tearm [ſeventh] mentioned in the explication of this Commandement, ſignifies the laſt day of ſeven; we have no law precedent to Gods example here mentioned, that commands the obſervation of the laſt day of the week for the day of reſt.
<note place="margin">As hath been ſhewed already that [ſeventh] in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment notes not the particular day.</note> Now the weakneſſe of the reaſons alleaged, to prove that this tearm [ſeventh] uſed in the explication of this law, ſignifies the laſt day of the week, we have ſhewed already. And by one reaſon have made it more then probable, that this tearm [ſeventh] in that place ſignifies only indefinitely one of ſeven, and not particularly ſuch a certain day of the ſeven. The ſecond reaſon which farther ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts that truth, and makes it evident,
<note place="margin">And is further proved, becauſe God mentions it not at all in the concluſion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> we have deferred untill now, and it is this; If God had intended to command that the laſt day of the week ſhould be obſerved for the Sabbath, he muſt and would have mentioned it in the concluſion of that reaſon by which he ſhews us the equity of the obſervation of that day rather then any other. Now he is ſo far from doing that, that he forbears the mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that name of [ſeventh] in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at all.</p>
                     <p>That this which we alleage may have the greater ſway with us,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> take ſpeciall notice that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:108952:151"/>the concluſion of this Commandement hath the very ſame words which we find in the firſt giving of this law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. whether the words themſelves were taken out of that hiſtory I will not peremptorily define, though it ſeems moſt probable.
<note place="margin">Whereas he preciſely names it in the Law given to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 2.</note> This is cleer, the words in both places are the ſame in every title elſe, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that in ſtead of the tearm [ſeventh] in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis,</hi> God uſeth the name [Sabbath] in this Law. This queſtionleſſe he doth not without reaſon (for God neither forgets, nor miſtakes, nor ſpeaks unadviſedly, as men do too often:) now what may be the reaſon why God makes choice of this word [Sabbath] in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Commandement? This is evident that by changing the word Seventh into Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which is of larger ſignification, the day of reſt is not ſo preciſely tied to the laſt day of the week in this fourth Commandement, as it is in the Law given to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 2. why then ſhould we not think that God intended in this law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to leave the ſet day of this holy reſt more at large, then he had done in the Commandement given to <hi>Adam?</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Why God might think it fit to do ſo,
<note place="margin">And might do, becauſe till Chriſt came the Creation of the world was Gods greateſt work, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to ground the law of the Sabbath upon.</note> we ſee manifeſt reaſon; for untill the fall of man, there could be no day fitter for the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an holy reſt unto God then the laſt day of the week, in which by the reſt of God from creating the creation of the world was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be fully perfected, which was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt work then done, or to be done, if man had
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:108952:151"/>not fallen. But now when man was fallen,
<note place="margin">But mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt being a greater work, required the altering of the Sabbath to the Firſt day of the week.</note> and therefore to be redeemed and created anew, which was a greater work then his creation at the firſt, ſo that a greater work and mercy of God to men was to be remembred, there was in a ſort a neceſſity of changing the day of reſt from the laſt to the firſt day of the week, on which mans redemption was to be perfected. And conſequently it was fit that the law given to man fallen, and to be redeemed, ſhould be ſo penned in generall tearms, that when this glorious work of mans redemption ſhould be perfected, there might be a change of the day of reſt without any change of the law.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond exception that we take againſt the drawing of the reaſon of this fourth Commandement,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/>
                        <note place="margin">1. To urge the keeping of the Sabbath from the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, ſhews not the equity of the law.</note> from the example of God reſting on the Sabbath day, to bind us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to the obſervation of the ſame day, for the day of our reſt, is this; A law we know is a rule of equity, and to give a reaſon of a law is to make it appear to be ſo. God then in giving this for a reaſon of this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could have no other aime before him, but by this reaſon to ſhew the equity of this law, both in appointing the proportion of time for an holy reſt, and in limiting it to ſuch a particular day. Now to draw the reaſon of our reſting from Gods reſting,
<note place="margin">Becauſe Gods condition and ours is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</note> ſhews no equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the law at all. We cannot make good this poſition, It is equal and juſt that we ſhould reſt becauſe God reſted. There is infinite odds
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:108952:152"/>between Gods condition and ours. God might reſt as long and as often as he pleaſed, ſeeing he hath al-ſufficienty in himſelf, and is not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by labour, as men and their eſtates are, who if they ſhould ceaſe from their labors too long or too often, muſt neceſſarily periſh. So that by reaſoning in this manner, that we muſt reſt becauſe God reſted too, cannot make the equity of this law appear at all.</p>
                     <p>Seeing therefore the equity of the law can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be evidenced by reaſoning from Gods meer act of reſting upon that day;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> let us now trie whether the other way of deducing the reaſon of the law from Gods advancing and honouring the ſeventh day by his reſting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and eſtabliſhing the rule of our reſt thereupon, do not more cleerly manifeſt the equity of this law in that particular.
<note place="margin">But drawing the reaſon from Gods honouring of that day by his reſt, the equity of the law is evident.</note> If we draw the reaſon of the law from the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ſeventh day, by Gods reſting upon that from all his works, we may conceive that he argues in this or that manner. That day which is honoured by God above other daies, by his moſt eminent works of mercy to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſhall be the day of holy reſt, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to him for his worſhip; but the day in which God ended and perfected the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, is the day honoured and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced above all other daies by that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full work, therefore that ſhall be the day of your holy reſt. In this ſyllogiſme the minor or ſecond propoſition only is expreſſed in the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:108952:152"/>words of the law, and that too only in part, for there is no more ſaid, but that God reſted that day, not that he honoured that day by his reſt, which notwithſtanding is neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; for he that ſaith that Chriſt roſe the firſt day of the week, muſt mean as much as if he had ſaid, Chriſt made the firſt day of the week honourable &amp; memorable by his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on that day. As for the major or firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in this ſyllogiſme, it is a principle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all men by the light of nature.</p>
                     <p>It is evident that daies and times in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are all equall,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> that which advanceth one day above another muſt be ſome memorable event that hath happened on that day. Again, that ſuch memorable events ought to be the ground upon which ſuch daies as God hath marked out by them,
<note place="margin">Laying down a ground upon whcih God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted other feaſts. And the Church.</note> and advanced above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daies, ought to be obſerved above other daies, is as cleer and evident. Wherefore we ſee that God himſelfe hath taken that for his ground of juſtifying the feaſts of Paſſeover and Pentecoſt, and in imitation of him the Jews upon the ſame ground took upon them the obſervation of the feaſt of <hi>Purim, Heſt.</hi> 9.21,
<note place="margin">Yea the very heathens led thereto by the light of nature.</note> 23. Yea the very heathen themſelves, as all hiſtories teſtifie, have alwaies made the daies of their birth, of founding their Cities, of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining memorable victories, and the like to be daies of annuall obſervance in joy and feaſting. So that to conſider the day of Gods reſt, as a day advanced above other daies, and thereupon
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:108952:153"/>to ordain that to be a day of holy rejoycing in God in remembrance of his great and glorious works, is to ſhew an equity acknowledged by light of nature in the inſtitution of the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas God both in all his waies,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
                        <note place="margin">God therefore purpoſing to ſhew the equity of this law, could not but ſet down the reaſon ſo as that might beſt appear:</note> but more eſpecially in his laws, takes ſpeciall care to make it appear unto men that they are all equall and juſt in all things, (as the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> acknowledgeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.128. both for his own honour, and withall to draw us the more cheerfully to obey and ſerve him) we cannot imagine that he being to give a reaſon of this law, and having ſo fair a ground, by which he might manifeſt the equity thereof e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to naturall reaſon it ſelf, ſhould conceal that, and propoſe another reaſon in which the equity of the law could not be manifeſted at all. Nay farther, whereas God inſiſts ſo much upon that ground, eſpecially in the inſtitution of the Paſſeover,
<note place="margin">Eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he doth it in ordaining other feaſts of leſſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> 
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.42. it ſeems very ſtrange that he ſhould againſt his cuſtome neglect or paſſe by that ground upon which he inſtituted other feaſts, in the inſtitution of the greateſt of all feaſts that ever was ordained in the Church. It ſeems therefore more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that this reaſon drawn from Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting upon the ſeventh day, muſt be deduced, not from Gods act in reſting on that day, but from the conſequent of that reſt, the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of that day by his reſting therein.</p>
                     <p>Some man perhaps may reply,

<note place="margin">Which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we draw the reaſon, it ſtill enforceth the obſervation of the ſeventh day.</note> it is all one, becauſe either way it binds us ſtill to the obſervation of the ſame ſeventh day. We anſwer, that although to the Jews it was all one, which way ſoever the reaſon was deduced, yet it makes a wide difference in the Commandement, to ordain the day to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, becauſe God reſted upon that day, or to command it to be obſerved, becauſe God honoured that day by his reſting therein:
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                        </label> for Gods reſting being a particular act,

So that if the reaſon be drawn from Gods act of reſting upon that day, if we change the day we alter the law, but if we draw the reaſon from Gods advancing of the day by his reſting therein above other daies, we alter not the law when we obſerve another day upon the ſame ground.</p>
                     <p>It may be objected yet farther,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> that this rule by which this holy day of reſt is aſſigned in this generall way, is both uncertain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; Uncertain,

                        </label> To this we anſwer, that the Sabbath day muſt needs be eſteemed the higheſt of all conſecrated times,
<note place="margin">1. Not uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</note> as being perpetually, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fally and more frequently to be obſerved then any other feſtival day.
<note place="margin">Becauſe it is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the day by the greateſt, moſt univerſall and perpetuall mercy beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed on the Church.</note> Whence it muſt needs follow that the work of mercy, upon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory whereof that day is founded, muſt be ſuch, as not only brings an univerſall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall benefit, but beſides, the greateſt of all benefits unto the Church. Now that the works of creating the world by Gods word in the beginning, and ſince of the redemption of it by Jeſus Chriſt, are the moſt eminent of all the mercies beſtowed by God upon man; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the fountain and foundation of all the reſt, the benefits whereof remain to the worlds end, is more evident then the light. And of theſe two the later being in all reſpects the far greater mercy, and therefore deſervedly carrying the obſervation of this holy day in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thereof, yet hath the wiſdome of God ſo ordered it, that in the conſecrating this day of reſt, both ſhould be remembred; the creation in the proportion of the time by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting apart one day of ſeven, and the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by changing the Sabbath from the laſt day of ſeven to the firſt, in which our Saviour by his reſurrection from the dead perfected that glorious work.

                        <note place="margin">2. Nor obſcure, becauſe the light of naturall reaſon may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it.</note> but that it may be underſtood of as many as deſire ſeriouſly to ſearch into it. For whereas the light of nature acknowledgeth &amp; teacheth (as we have ſhewed already) this principle, that the obſervation of feſtivall daies, is moſt fitly grounded upon the remembrance of ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable event or other, which hath hapned upon thoſe daies which are to be obſerved, when we read in this Commandement, that God appoints his Sabbath to be kept upon the day on which he finiſhed the Creation of the World, even naturall reaſon will ſuggeſt, that in this inſtitution God obſerves the rule of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in ordering that for the day of this ſolemne Feaſt, on which the greateſt generall benefit which (till the Redemption of the world by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt) had been wrought for mankind from the beginning, was accompliſhed. Now that rule which the very light of nature approves being obſerved by God, in appointing the day for this holy reſt, naturall reaſon will lead us on to conclude, that when a more eminent work then the Creation of the World is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, it muſt carry the obſervation of the Sabbath unto that day on which it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, upon the ſame ground, and by the ſame rule, by which it was firſt ordained to be obſerved upon another day.

                     <p>It may be farther objected,

That the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath; he means for mans comfort and refreſhing, for which kindling of fire and dreſſing of meat may be, and are in a ſort neceſſary. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our allows the looſing of a beaſt from the ſtall, and leading of him to the water on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day: now we know, the beaſt might be provided for by ſetting water in the ſtall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, which would refreſh it ſufficiently, and better then meat dreſſed overnight could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort many men. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> we find our Saviour preſent at a great feaſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.1. where many, and it ſeems perſons of quality, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7.12. were bidden: now it is very unlikely that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for that feaſt were dreſſed over night; and if it were dreſſed on that day, neither

For Manna it may be might be as good and comfortable eaten cold as hot, and the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring overnight, might be no inconvenience at all; howſoever it is out of queſtion that in that unſetled condition of the Iſraelites wandring in the wilderneſſe, when they were enforced to pick up fewell, where they could get it, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and boyling muſt needs be more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and laborious then it was afterwards in <hi>Canaan,</hi> where being ſetled in their dwellings, they had all things whereof they were to make uſe for ſuch works provided and ready at hand.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude,

<note place="margin">Howſoever ſuch ſtrictneſſe of reſt was not required of them by the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> to have been as great as they imagine, it muſt needs be granted that there is no clauſe in the fourth Commandement that enjoyns it, which requires no more then a reſt from our ordinary ſecular employments, that we may be at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to attend wholly upon the duties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip, that we conſecrate the whole day unto God, as the words of that law do

So the reſt of the laws that enjoyn ſuch ſtrictneſſe of reſt being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the fourth Commandement may remain fully in force in every clauſe of it. And (as it hath been already intimated) it concerns us to take ſpeciall notice of Gods expreſſion, [Six days ſhalt thou labour and do all thy work] by which he can mean nothing elſe but the works of our particular callings, which only may be properly called our works: for there be generall works which be proper to all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and ſubordinate thereunto, as to eat and drink, and to cloath our ſelves, and to make uſe of the reſt of the comforts of this life, by which we are ſtrengthned and enabled to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in our particular callings. Theſe cannot properly be called our works, and are as well to be done on the Sabbath as on other days, with this difference only, that whereas they are done on other days to enable us to labour, they are to be done on the Sabbath to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then us to holy duties.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reaſons which we have laid down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="52"/> amount to little leſſe then a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the reſt of the Sabbath muſt be the reſt of a whole day, or the ſeventh part of the week, which we Chriſtians have both as much cauſe, and as much need to conſecrate unto God as ever the Iews had in times paſt. And that we may do it with as little detriment to our ſelves in our ſecular affairs, and with as much aſſurance to have our labours of ſix days
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:108952:161"/>ſo bleſſed, that they ſhall be ſufficient for the diſpatch of our needfull employments, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the reaſon which is annexed to that Commandement, which proves it by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world by God in ſix days, a ground of faith which concerns us as well as the Iews. Wherefore ſeeing we have as great reaſon, as great helps, and as great encouragements by the aſſurance of Gods bleſſing upon our ſix days labour, to ſanctifie an entire day of holy reſt unto God, as the Iews had; And ſeeing the expreſſe words of the law appoint the whole day to be conſecrated unto God, why ſhould not we take our ſelves to be as ſtrongly bound as the Iews were to the keeping of the holy reſt of this whole day, which we call the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, ſeeing there appears no ſufficient reaſon why we ſhould judge any jot or title of this law to be taken away? For as for thoſe alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, that the reſt of the Sabbath was a type of Chriſts reſt in the grave, and a part of the Iewiſh bondage, how little force they have, we have ſhewed before.</p>
                     <p>Now then if it evidently appear to all that will conſider things with any indifferency,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/> by all that we have ſaid, that neither the reſting from our labour one day in ſeven, nor the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing of that reſt for the whole day, nor yet the ſtrictneſſe of any reſt enjoyned by the fourth Commandement, are either as ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, or upon any other ground to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: neither that the particular day of reſt

                     <p>It hath been intimated before,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="54"/> that mens miſtake of the right interpretation of the fourth Commandement, hath been a great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of queſtioning the perpetuity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of the morall law; and of how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequent it is to admit that there is any thing mutable therein, experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us, when we find how ready men are to embrace and hold that dangerous errour of caſting aſide the whole law, and that ſo far as to deny it to be a rule of direction unto us Chriſtians in the courſe of our practice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they open a wide gap to all licentiouſneſſe, and by that means overthrow the very life and power of godlineſſe, to the high diſhonour of God, and to the extream perill of their own ſouls: ſo that we ſee how neerly it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all ſuch as have any true zeal for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Gods honour and their own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and their brethrens, to endeavour by all the means that they can, the eſtabliſhing and maintaining of this truth, that the morall law given by God to <hi>Adam</hi> in the beginning, and renewed afterwards by <hi>Moſes</hi> upon mount

                     <p>The premiſes then being duly weighed and layed together,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="55"/> we have a ſufficient ground to argue in this manner:

                     <p>HAving now eſtabliſhed the perpetuity of that Law which we call Morall,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in all the Commandements thereof, it is time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to that from which we digreſſed; namely, the delivering of rules for our direction in drawing out obſervations from the Laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture for our inſtruction, and there being three kinds of theſe Laws, Morall, Judiciall, Ceremoniall, (as we have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) of theſe the Morall law comes firſt to be conſidered. Now, that Law being given to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the roote of mankind, and that not ſo much to his perſon, as to the nature of man, which was wholly in him, when he received this Law from God; and conſequently binding all thoſe who are partakers of that nature, it muſt needs be acknowledged that whatſoever commands we find therein, we muſt guide our ſelves by, as the rule of our practice. Which that we may the better doe, it will be needfull to lay before us ſome rules,

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:108952:163"/>that theſe ten words, (as they are called) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe all the heads of duties to be performed both to God, and man. This is clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by our Saviours anſwer to the Lawyer that tempted him, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.26. enquiring what he might doe to inherit eternall life, to whom Chriſt replies, that whatſoever duty was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the attaining thereof, was to be found in the commandements, where he wils him to ſeek it. Now theſe precepts being delivered in ſuch briefe expreſſions, as they are, it muſt needs follow that every one of the tearms in them muſt needs be of exceeding large compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</p>

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:108952:164"/>in the heart, yea, even to raſh, and unadviſed anger towards him. And he extends adultery as far as the luſting after a woman in ones heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22, 28.</p>

                     <p>Now let all that we have ſpoken be laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> 
                        <hi>firſt,</hi> that the Law is of ſo large extent, that it regulates not only mens outward actions, but beſides the very inward thoughts of the heart, and that ſo far that it preſcribes a rule to the very firſt motions that ariſe therein, though they be not ſeconded either with deliberation, or conſent; nay, beyond all that it exacts recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude &amp; uprightnes in the very frame and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the heart, commanding not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto the law, but withall practice anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the rules thereof. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that it ſtrictly requires the putting forth of all the ſtrength, and the utmoſt ability of all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſoule, and that in every part of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, yea and ſo far that it requires, that both in the ſubſtance of the duty, and in the manner of performance, and in the end at which we aime, we come fully home to that meaſure of perfection, that the law requires. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> that it laies an everlaſting curſe upon every one
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:108952:169"/>that comes ſhort of the full performance of every thing contained in the law. Let (I ſay) all theſe be laid together, and ſeriouſly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the heart, and it will eaſily be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that, conſidering the weakneſſe of our preſent condition, by which the fulfilling of the law is made utterly impoſſible to us, one of the principall uſes of the law muſt needs be that which the Apoſtle ſaies before us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. to be a Schoolmaſter to lead us and drive us to Chriſt, to ſeek from him that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which may juſtifie us before God, which we have not in, or of our ſelves, and that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by which he fully diſcharged our debt, which he took upon himſelfe, when he made his ſoule a ſacrifice for our ſinnes, and thereby wholly freed us from that curſe of the law, which our diſobedience thereunto had brought upon us.</p>
                     <p>So then wee ſee that the morall law hath a double uſe unto us:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/>
                        <note place="margin">A double uſe of the morall law. 1. To be our guide, and rule to walk by.</note> The <hi>firſt</hi> to ſerve for a rule to guide us in the whole courſe of our practice, (in which reſpect holy <hi>David</hi> uſed it as a lanthorn to his feet, and a light unto his ſteps, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105.) unto which we are to come as neare as poſſibly we are able, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our waies that we may turne our feet to Gods teſtimonies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59. and uſing our uttermoſt endeavours to make our practice fully conformable thereunto, laying thoſe judgements alwaies before us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.30. calling our ſelves daily to account, and laying
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:108952:170"/>all our actions to that perfect rule which will eaſily diſcover unto us our errours and failings in all the courſe of our converſation, which when we have bewailed in the bitterneſſe of our ſpirits, and taken ſhame to our ſelves for our groſſe and manifold neglects, our hearts are kept in a low frame, and we are fitted to walk humbly before our God with reverence and holy feare, and in all meekneſſe towards our brethren, and are withall moved to engage our ſelves by new purpoſes and promiſes, to walke more faithfully, and watchfully with God for time to come.
<note place="margin">2. To ſhew us the great need of Chriſt, and to drive us to him.</note> The <hi>ſecond</hi> uſe of the Morall law unto us, is, to ſhew us the great need of Chriſt by whoſe righteouſneſſe only (and not by our own) we are juſtified before God, and by his ſatisfactions and ſufferings are delivered from the wrath to come: By the conſideration whereof we are brought to prize and value Chriſt above all things in the world, to uſe all endeavours to get a ſure intereſt in him, although it ſhould be with the loſſe of all things beſides, and to cleave faſt unto him who is our life, living in him by faith, (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.) giving up our ſelves to live wholly to him, who hath died for us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us unto himſelfe, that we might ſerve him in holineſſe all our daies.</p>
                     <p>Thus farre then of the Morall law,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> and the uſe thereof;
<note place="margin">Of Laws cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall.</note> the next kind of laws which we are to conſider, are thoſe which we call Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, becauſe they preſcribed the rules of thoſe
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:108952:170"/>ceremonies, which God appointed to be uſed in his worſhip by the Jews untill the coming of Chriſt, of whom many of them were ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.
<note place="margin">Now wholly taken away in uſe of them.</note> Now although all thoſe rites and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are by Chriſts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming wholly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſo that we are no longer obliged to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any of them in the worſhip of God, nor indeed can uſe many of them, without the denying of Chriſts comming in the fleſh: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſeeing it hath pleaſed the Lord to leave both them, and the Judiciall laws upon record, amongſt thoſe holy writings which he hath thought fit to preſerve, and to commit unto the Church to be kept for poſterity, to the end of the world; we cannot conceive that he hath taken ſo much care to preſerve them in vaine, nor indeed for any other end then that which is the ſcope of the reſt of the Scriptures,
<note place="margin">Yet may they be of uſe to us in reading them.</note> that they might be for our learning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. What inſtructions therefore we may gather to our ſelves by reading theſe laws, we are now to conſider. And that the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many men upon this opinion and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that theſe laws are now utterly aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to us Chriſtians,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> either totally neglect the reading of thoſe books,
<note place="margin">1. In that they were ſhadows of Chriſt, it proves that from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there was no ſalvation but in his name.</note> as containing thoſe things that concerne them not, or at leaſt read them in ſuch a perfunctory manner, without ſearching into them, that they receive no profit, nor inſtruction by them at all.</p>
                     <p>That we may therefore ſhew what inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions the reading of the ceremoniall law may
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:108952:171"/>yeeld us, we muſt <hi>firſt</hi> take notice that theſe ceremonies may be ranked under two heads; For they are either figures that repreſented to the Jews Chriſt to come, as did their Paſſeover, ſacrifices, ſcapegoat, &amp;c. or they were outward ſhadows of inward ſanctification, ſuch as were many of their waſhings, ſeparating, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of leapers, &amp;c. As for the former ſort of theſe, which under divers types point us out Chriſt to come, we are more particularly to obſerve that they repreſent him as a ſacrifice for ſin, a lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world; the ſcape-goat ſets out the fruit of his ſuffering, the utter removing from us, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away our ſins into the wilderneſſe, that they may never appear nor be remembred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us any more: the like repreſentations we have in many of the reſt. By which we learn that as from the beginning there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name by which men might be ſaved but only the name of Jeſus Chriſt, promiſed to our firſt Parents, expected by the Patriarchs, and both to them after they were formed into a ſtate, repreſented many ways although under figures and ſhadows, ſo they were to expect ſalvation by him no other way but by his death, nor any other ſalvation then by taking our ſins upon him, and thereby making our peace with God his Father. This conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a great means to ſtrengthen our faith, when we are compaſſed with ſo great a cloud of witneſſes, teſtifying that truth which we
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:108952:171"/>believe, in all ages from the beginning.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort of ceremonies are ſuch as are under the figures of waſhings,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/>
                        <note place="margin">2. As under le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall waſhing ſanctification is ſhadowed, we are taught to cleanſe our ſelves in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neer unto God.</note> legall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and purifications, and the like repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Iews, that inward purity and cleanſing of the heart, which God requires in all his people, eſpecially thoſe that draw neer unto him in the performance of ſuch duties of his worſhip as he hath commanded: unto this the Pſalmiſt alludes in that expreſſion of his, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.6. as likewiſe doth the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16.

<note place="margin">Acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thankfully the liberty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed to us by Chriſt;</note> 
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> to raiſe up our hearts to a thankfull acknowledgement of Gods great mercy to us, who hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Ieſus Chriſt, to take off that heavy yoke from our ſhoulders, and to ſet us at liberty in compariſon of them, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.1. which ſhould be a great inducement unto us, not only to bear, but to take up that eaſie yoke (as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf calls it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29.) and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the cheerfull uſe of thoſe holy and quickening ordinances, which Chriſt hath left unto his Church, and that without any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe at all, or any murmuring at our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:108952:172"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> ſeeing thoſe laws had no more but ſhadows of good things to come,
<note place="margin">And bewailing our blindneſſe in this cleer ſunſhine of the Goſpel,</note> but had not the things themſelves, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. and even thoſe ſhadows too, but in carnall ordinances, as they are called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. whereas we now have the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thoſe alſo repreſented unto us in a more ſpirituall way: Let it be in the reading of thoſe ordinances, and comparing them with the writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles (wherein both Chriſts himſelf, and the things freely given us by God in him, are ſo fully and cleerly ſet before us, that he that runs may read them) be an effectuall means to move us to reflect upon our ſelves, that bewailing our blindneſſe in ſo clear a light, ſhining out unto us like the Sun in his ſtrength, and our dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart in the uſe of theſe ſpirituall and quickning means which the Lord hath ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly afforded unto us,

                     </p>
                     <p>One thing more it may be fit for us to take into conſideration in the reading of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall law, which is this;
<note place="margin">5. Though we uſe not the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies themſelves, yet we may draw rules from them for our direction.</note> Howſoever thoſe ceremonies be aboliſhed, yet whereſoever they are directed to an end, which is common to us with them there, though we obſerve not the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:108952:173"/>ceremony it ſelf, yet we from them draw a rule which may be of uſe unto us in the duties of our worſhip: As for example, our Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and the Jewiſh agree in this, that as they are holy, ſo they ought to be kept holy, and free from pollution, by excluding unclean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from the uſe of them. The care of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law was committed to the Prieſts who had the charge of the holy things, and are therefore juſtly taxed for neglect of their duty in not keeping ſtrangers and uncircumciſed perſons from the ſanctuary, &amp; from thoſe holy things that were offered therein, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.7, 8. Now ſeeing our ordinances are in all reſpects as holy as thoſe of the Iews were, the charge of keeping their holy things undefiled, cannot but extend unto us that are Chriſtians. And ſeeing that charge was part of the office of the Leviticall Prieſthood, unto which our Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry under the Goſpel ſucceeds; how can we deny that the care of keeping our Sacraments, and other ordinances from pollution by the promiſcuous admiſſion of unworthy perſons to partake of them with us, ought to be a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall part of the care of the Miniſters under the Goſpel, as it was of the Prieſts under the law?</p>
                     <p>Having then hitherto diſcovered what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions we may draw out unto our ſelves from the conſideration of the ceremoniall Law in generall,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> we ſhall forbear to deſcend to the ſcanning of the particular ceremonies preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:108952:173"/>therein, as being a work not altogether ſo neceſſary, nor altogether ſutable to that bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity that we aime at in this ſhort Treatiſe. Thus much only is fit to be intimated by the way, that where the ſignification of thoſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious ſhadows is plain and evident, it will be both a delightfull and profitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, to take ſpeciall notice both of the things ſignified by them, and of the ſhadows themſelves that repreſent them.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place we are to take into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration thoſe laws which we call Judiciall,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/>
                        <note place="margin">Of the Judicial laws given by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                        </note> given by God unto the Iews for the ordering of their civill State, which are but deductions out of the morall law applied and fitted to the preſent State of the Iews, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence binding no other State to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, but that alone; yea now,
<note place="margin">Which by the diſſolution of the Jewiſh State are made void:</note> that State to which they were given is utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, quite made void and taken away. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ſeeing theſe laws as well as the ceremoniall, are left upon record unto the Church of God,
<note place="margin">Yet being left upon record unto us, we may draw from them ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for our ſelves.</note> we are to judge of thoſe as well as we have done of them, that they are preſerved unto us for ſome ſpeciall uſe (as the Apoſtle tells us, that whatſoever things were written before time were written for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4.) the rather, becauſe we know that God hath ſuffered ſome writings of holy men, as <hi>Iddoes</hi> Hiſtory, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.22. and <hi>Henochs</hi> Propheſie, <hi>Jude</hi> 14. to periſh, as not eſteeming them ſo neceſſary for the uſe of the

                     <p>Let us therefore enquire what inſtructions we may gather unto our ſelves,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> out of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and conſidering of thoſe laws, which we call Iudiciall, or rules for the ordering of the civill ſtate of the Iews.
<note place="margin">1. We muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that God hath a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall hand in civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Not to inſiſt upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, out of the conſideration of them in generall there will ariſe theſe foure obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>Firſt,</hi> in that God took ſo much care for his own people, as not only to give them rules for his own worſhip, but beſides to leave with them directions and laws for the ordering of their civill affairs, we may take notice that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the diſpoſing of civill government belongs unto the Lord himſelf, by whom Kings reigne and Princes decree juſtice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15, 16. and the Apoſtle tels us, that the powers that be are ordained of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. Neither are the rulers onely from him, but the government al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; as they judge by him, ſo he judgeth among them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. and howſoever men ſeek the Rulers favour, yet every mans Iudgement comes from the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.26.</p>
                     <p>It is true that in this the Jews had a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar priviledge above any nation on the earth,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> that they had the whole frame of their Civill government laid out unto them by God himſelfe, they had not only his Laws, but his Statutes, and his Judgements too, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.20. under which name <hi>Moſes</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends both the Judiciall, and Ceremomiall
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:108952:174"/>Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.31. Notwithſtanding we have ſufficient warrant, that the Lord hath the ſame care of his Church in any State, that he had of the Jews then; ſo that the Laws in any Nation, as farre as they are juſt and equall, are to be eſteemed the Laws of God, and the judgements executed by them, come from the Lord. Whence we are taught, as to pray unto God for thoſe that are in authority, that we may lead a peaceable life under them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. So when Rulers ſo governe, that the righteous may flouriſh in abundance of Peace, (as it ſhall be in Chriſts Kingdome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.7.) that they that doe well may have praiſe, and wrath may be executed upon thoſe that doe evill, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3, 4. the honour and praiſe for ſuch agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be returned to God alone.

                     <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Rule that we may frame unto our ſelves out of the conſideration of the judiciall Law,
<note place="margin">2.

Whence all law-makers may take a patterne in making their laws, to ſquare them out by no other rule, then that which God himſelfe obſerved in the making of his Laws for his own people. So that although States in making their Laws may make uſe of Chriſtian Prudence, in applying them to times, places, perſons, and emergent occaſions; yet we muſt be ſure that all ſuch laws muſt have the

For example, the Lord commands his people to make battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about their houſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.8. the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof he expreſſeth in the ſame place, was the preventing of danger to mens lives, if any ſhould fall from thence in walking upon the roofe thereof, unleſſe there were ſome ſuch meanes to prevent it. Now although we have no cauſe in building our houſes to build ſuch battlements about them, ſeeing our houſes being not ſlat-roofed as theirs were, have no ſuch walkes on the tops of them, from which men falling might endanger their lives, yet we are by the ſcope and end at which the law aimes, taught in generall to uſe the beſt meanes to prevent all danger to our neighbours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which our care and providence might foreſee.</p>

As for inſtance, whereas the Lord thinks it ſufficient to puniſh ſimple theft with reſtitution of double or foure fold, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.1. we may doe well to conſider whether our laws be not too ſtrict in puniſhing bare theft, (at leaſt in women) with death without remedy.

For who can better judge of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of offences, and puniſhments fit for the reſtraint of them, then God himſelfe? Neither can we excuſe our ſelves by this, that thoſe laws being Judiciall are now taken away and made voide unto us, ſeeing where our caſe is the ſame (as adultery and theft are the ſame in what ſtate ſo ever) there our rules of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all equity ought to be the ſame.</p>
                     <p>In generall it will be very needfull to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve carefully the equity and righteouſneſſe of all theſe laws, as well Judiciall as Morall,

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:108952:182"/>from God, to do what they did, though it were not according to the generall rule of the Law. As the Iſraelites borrowed Jewells of Gold, and Jewells of Silver, of the Aegyptians by Gods expreſſe command, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11.2. which they never paid againe; yet we know, that to borrow and not pay againe is the Character of a wicked man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.21. Yea where there is no outward and verball command from God, yet ſome times men by a ſecret inſtinct of the Spirit are warranted to do that which without it had been unlawfull, as it was not lawfull for the Apoſtles to call for fire from heaven to conſume thoſe Samaritanes, that refuſed to receive Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.54. becauſe <hi>Elijah</hi> had done the like, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.10, 12.</p>

The way of it is plain and familiar, becauſe it moſt concerns the weak. Each page hath the figures for the day of the Moneth ſet in the firſt place, which ſerve for the three Moneths that are in that page. Each days task is three Chapters: two in the Old <hi>Teſtament,</hi> and one in the <hi>New,</hi> ſo long as the <hi>New</hi> doth laſt. And this order is conſtant, excepting in the <hi>Pſalmes:</hi> where, becauſe ſome are ſo very ſhort, there is ſometimes two, ſometime more to bee taken together at one reading. Onely the hundred-nineteenth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is too long for one reading, is divided into four portions: Six parts apeece for the two former, and Five a peece for the two latter: which portions exceed not the length of an ordinary Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <p>As for the day which is <hi>ſupernumerary</hi> in the Leap years (that is, which is above 365.) I rather leave to thy Diſcretion and Piety how to imploy to Gods glory, and thy own ſolace, then preſcribe any thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the time: It is very requiſite to obſerve it ſtrictly; that is, to read one Chapter in the morning, another at noon, and the third at night: ſo thou ſhalt never want heavenly matter to take up thy thoughts. But, whatever is omitted in the day time, muſt be made out at night. If it ſo fall out, that ſome days or weeks task be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (as by ſickneſſe, or the like) when thou comeſt to it again, double the daily task till the loſſe be repaired. And whereas the <hi>Lords day</hi> is here made onely equall to other days, in its task and ſervice; thou muſt ever make it a <hi>Feaſt of Fat things,</hi> by adding to it a <hi>Portion</hi> in ſome <hi>Book</hi> or other, which thy ſoul moſt affecteth: be it <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> or the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> or any of the <hi>Goſpels,</hi> &amp;c. But the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in this reſpect, may not wholly be omitted; this day being a ſingular day above others, for ſinging and rejoycing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For good ſucceſſe, and proficiency in this holy employment; pray conſtantly to him that hath the <hi>Key of David,</hi> to unlock thy <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> and uſe ſuch helps as the Lord affordeth thee. And when thou <hi>Doubteſt,</hi> fail not to goe to the <hi>Maſter of the Aſſembly,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.11. <hi>Seek the Law at his mouth,</hi> for ſo thou oughteſt to doe, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac.</hi> 2.7.</p>
                  <p>To help a bad memory, doe this; read with <hi>Leiſure</hi> and <hi>Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Meditate</hi> with <hi>Delight,</hi> (this feeds the ſoul) <hi>Conferre</hi> with others at all opportunities, eſpecially, with thoſe whom God hath ſet <hi>neare</hi> thee, or given thee in <hi>Charge,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6, 7, 8, 9. &amp; <hi>c.</hi> 11.18, 19, 20.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>By this means (God bleſſing it to us) Chriſts kingdome ſhall come into our hearts with <hi>Power,</hi> and his <hi>Scepter</hi> (which is his <hi>Word</hi>) will bear <hi>Sway,</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> in all private Families amongſt us: even in thoſe Families which hitherto have forgotten the <hi>Name</hi> of their God, and walking on ſtill in <hi>Darkneſſe,</hi> as without God in the World, <hi>Have counted thoſe great things of Gods Law, as a ſtrange thing,</hi> Hoſ. 8.12.</p>

If theſe <hi>Motives</hi> availe not to winne thee to a liking of the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Practiſing</hi> of it; conſider further, what need thou haſt of it, and what it is which thou deſpiſeſt, in rejecting it. Thy heart is as hard as a ſtone in thee, but this <hi>Word</hi> is as <hi>a hammer, that breaketh the Rock in pieces,</hi> Jer. 23.29.

It is the word of Gods power,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>The power of God unto Salvation, to every one that beleeveth,</hi> Rom. 1.16.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.

The hand of the Diligent maketh rich: but the field of the man void of Vnderſtanding, is all
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:108952:185"/>grown over with Thorns. Ignorance of the Scriptures, is the mother of</hi> Error, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.29. leaving a gappe open to all <hi>Lewdneſſe, Riot,</hi> and <hi>Exorbitancy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thinkeſt thou to have <hi>Eternall life</hi> in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and yet art not acquainted with them? The <hi>Promiſe</hi> is, <hi>Seek and you ſhall finde.</hi> And thou mayeſt ſeek <hi>Eternall life,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (the <hi>Authour</hi> and giver of <hi>Life</hi>) where he is to be found, he commands thee <hi>to ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> Ioh. 5.39.</p>
                  <p>To goe further yet; our Saviour intimates to us, that the <hi>Iews</hi> would never have troubled him ſo often with ſleight queſtions, if they had uſed to read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as diligently as they ought. And when they poſed him, he uſually ſent them to read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> for their anſwer. So <hi>Luke</hi> 10.26. he returns one to learn his <hi>Duty, What is written in the Law? How readeſt thou?</hi> And ſo others of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Have ye not read what David did?</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Have ye not read in the Law?</hi> &amp;c. So likewiſe <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.16.</p>
                  <p>So that the reading of the holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> is a <hi>Duty</hi> that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our preſſed often. And his exhortation (before quoted) <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. is to all. Neither ſhould thy worldly imployments hinder thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this <hi>Duty,</hi> for even the king (though he might plead the greateſt hinderances of any whatſoever, even the weighty affairs of his Kingdome) was not exempted from this daily task, the <hi>reading</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.19.</p>
                  <p>Here is both <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Promiſe.</hi> Yea, this <hi>Practiſe</hi> hath a <hi>Bleſſing, Rev.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed is he that readeth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And that thou mayſt not be diſcouraged, either through thy <hi>own incapacity,</hi> or <hi>its obſcurity;</hi> know, that this courſe of exerciſing in the <hi>Word</hi> of God, is bleſſed with happy ſucceſſe from the firſt med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with it, and that even to the <hi>weakeſt,</hi> Pſal. 119.130. <hi>The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of thy words giveth light: it giveth underſtanding to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> But if after all theſe <hi>Incitements,</hi> thou count thy ſelf <hi>unworthy</hi> of <hi>eternall life,</hi> and wilt not lay hold of it; I muſt alſo put thee in mind (ere I leave thee) that where theſe <hi>Bleſſings</hi> take no place, there the <hi>Curſe</hi> enters. When they that ſearch the <hi>Scriptures</hi> finde <hi>Eternall life,</hi> they that neglect them will finde <hi>Eternall death.</hi> When the <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Diligent</hi> enter into their <hi>Maſters Joy,</hi> the <hi>Slothfull</hi> and <hi>Fooliſh</hi> will be thruſt into <hi>Hell.</hi>
